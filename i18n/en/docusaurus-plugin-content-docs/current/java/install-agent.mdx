### Agent installation file configuration{#agent-files}

The agent file consists of a tracer that extracts data for application monitoring and passes to the WhaTap collection server, and the elements that help the tracer send the data.

-   _whatap.conf_

    This configuration file stores monitoring agent settings, access key, and WhaTap data collection server IP. For more information, see [the following](set-agent).

-   _security.conf_ `Java agent 2.2.2 or later`

    Enter the password (6-letter alpha-numeric value) to stop threads and check various variables on the screen.

    ```ini title='security.conf'
    paramkey=ABCDEF # SQL variable and HTTP query lookup
    threadkill=ABCDEF # Thread stop function
    ```

-   _paramkey.txt_ `Java agent 2.2.2 or earlier`

    Enter the password (6-letter alpha-numeric value) to check various variables on the screen.

    ```ini title='paramkey.txt'
    ABCDEF # SQL variable and HTTP query lookup
    ```

    :::note

    When updating from the Java agent version to 2.2.2, the key values in the existing _paramkey.txt_ file are automatically applied to the ones in the _seuciry.conf_ file. For example, if you used `FEDCBA` in _paramkey.txt_ and updated to the version 2.2.2, it is applied to the _security.conf_ file as follows.

    ```ini
    paramkey=FEDCBA
    threadkill=FEDCBA
    ```

    If the _paramkey.txt_ file does not exist, the key value of the _security.conf_ file is automatically created as the key value of **WHATAP**.

    :::

-   _ping.sh(bat)_

    This script (batch) file checks whether there are any settings or network issues by attempting communication with the access key and WhaTap data collection server.

-   _proxy.sh(bat)_

    Script (batch) file to start the _whatap.agent.proxy-`X.Y.Z`.jar_ file.

-   _resmon.sh(bat)_

    Script (batch) file to check whether the CPU, memory, and disk data are collected normally.

-   _whatap-logsink-lz4-`X.Y.Z`.jar_

    This plug-in file collects the log data of the application server.

-   _whatap.agent-`X.Y.Z`.jar_

    This monitoring agent file collects and transfers various monitoring data of the application server to the collection server.

-   _whatap.agent.proxy-`X.Y.Z`.jar_

    This application acts as a transit in the proxy server (pass-through server), when the server where the application server operates cannot connect directly to the WhaTap collection server.

-   _logs/whatap-`yyyymmdd`.log_

    It is the log file generated by the monitoring agent.

## Adding the JVM options{#addjvmopt}

The method how to set depending on the application server environment is provided as follows. Before installing and applying the agent, check [Support environment](supported-spec) first.
