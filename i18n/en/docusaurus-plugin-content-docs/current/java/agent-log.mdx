When the application server runs, it starts collecting the monitoring data. The collected data is stored in the log file.

## Setting the path and name

The path and name of the agent log can be set in _whatap.conf_. The default value of `log_root` is the _${WHATAP_HOME}/logs_ path.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
log_root=System.getProperty("whatap.home", ".") + "/logs"
log_name=whatap
```

## Log management options

By writing the log-related options in _whatap.conf_, you can manage the log content.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
watchlog_enabled=true
log_rotation_enabled=true
log_oname_enabled=true
log_keep_days=7
```

{@include: ../common-items/_java-agent-log-list.mdx}  

## LogSink{#logsink}

In whatap.agent-2.1.0 or later, the LogSink function is provided for integrated monitoring of the application server.

{@include: ../common-items/_java-logsink.mdx}
