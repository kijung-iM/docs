title: Automatic deletion of the agent in Scale In
description: It provides the method how to automatically delete an agent when a scale in occurs in the Auto Scale environment.

If an agent name is automatically assigned in the Auto Scale environment, administrator's intervention is not required when a scale out occurs. The system scales up automatically. If a scale in occurs, the system must recognize it as a graceful shutdown.

For automatic deletion of the agent, the WhaTap server must receive messages from the Java agent. The agent sends a **SILENT_SHUTDOWN** event to the Whatap server when the _whatap\_{java-process-pid>}.shutdown_ file of the Java process appears in `${WHATAP_HOME}`. Transfers are completed within 5 seconds.

When the **SILENT_SHUTDOWN** event has been transferred to the WhaTap server and then the agent is shut down within 1 minute, the WhaTap server deletes the agent from the list. Any inactive event does not occur.

:::note
Tomcat의 경우 _shutdown.sh_ 파일에 설정할 수 있습니다.

```bash title=$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh
touch $WHATAP_HOME/whatap_{java-process-pid}.shutdown
```
