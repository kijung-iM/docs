WhaTap Oracle Cloud Monitor collects metrics periodically through API integration. It collects the target stats every 5 minutes from the Oracle Cloud Monitor namespace of the desired service. When you start monitoring, you can search for user resources in all regions and start monitoring with one click. You can use it safely and conveniently by automatically generating the ssh public key required for authentication. 

{@include: ../getting-started/_create-project-cloud.mdx}
