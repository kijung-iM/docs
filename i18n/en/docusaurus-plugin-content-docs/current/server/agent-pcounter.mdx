The Windows performance count can be arbitrarily collected. 

Add the performance counter set name to the WhaTap server monitoring configuration file. 

-   The performance counter set name can be retrieved.
    ```bash title='Windows Powershell'
    Get-Counter -ListSet *
    ```

-   A performance counter set can be added in the configuration file.
    ```bash title='Windows Powershell'
    Add-Content -Path "C:\Program Files\WhatapInfra\whatap.conf" -Value "performance.counter.$(Get-Date -uformat %s)=Performance counter set name to view"
    ```

-   In **_Analysis_** > **_Metrics Search_**, the added performance counter can be searched by **_category_** `performance_counter_{performance counter set name}`.
