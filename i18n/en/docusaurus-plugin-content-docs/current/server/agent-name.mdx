For a user-friendly name, you can specify it in the configuration file as follows.

-   **Linux Shell**

    ```bash title=SH
    export WHATAP_SERVER_NAME=user-friendly name

    echo "oname=$WHATAP_SERVER_NAME" |sudo tee -a /usr/whatap/infra/conf/whatap.conf
    ```

-   **Windows Power Shell** 

    ```bash title=SH
    # The admin role is required.
    $WHATAP_SERVER_NAME="user-friendly name"

    Add-Content "C:\Program Files\WhatapInfra\whatap.conf" "oname=$WHATAP_SERVER_NAME"
    ```
