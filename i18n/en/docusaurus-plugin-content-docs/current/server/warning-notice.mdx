You can adjust the excess per 2 seconds with the following option.

-   **Linux**

    > `log.skip.threshold=number of lines that can be processed per 2 seconds` in the _/usr/whatap/infra/conf/whatap.conf_ file

-   **Windows**

    > `log.skip.threshold=number of lines that can be processed per 2 seconds` in the _C:\\Program Files\\WhatapInfra\\whatap.conf_ file
