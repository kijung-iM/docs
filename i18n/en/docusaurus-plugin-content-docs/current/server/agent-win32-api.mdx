When collecting the performance metrics such as CPU, memory, disk, traffic, and process, use the Win32 API. It can be used to collect performance metrics in an environment where the Windows performance counter is turned off or unavailable.

Add the `native_api.enabled=true` option in the WhaTap server monitoring configuration file. Apply the following in the powershell.

```bash title='Windows Powershell'
Add-Content -Path "C:\Program Files\WhatapInfra\whatap.conf" -Value "native_api.enabled=true"
Restart-Service "Whatap Infra"
```
