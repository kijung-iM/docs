1.  Download the **agent file**.\
    At the top of **_Management_** > **_Agent Installation_**, select a server OS under ![number-s](/img/number-01.png) OS tab. In the ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) **_Download Installation File_** tab, select _whatap_infra.exe_ or _whatap_infra.zip_ to download the agent installation file.  

    :::note

    -   The _.zip_ file is also provided for the users who cannot accept _.exe_ files due to security issues.
    -   For server security, it is recommended to run the downloaded installation file rather than installing through the browser.
