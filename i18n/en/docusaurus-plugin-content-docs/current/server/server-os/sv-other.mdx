import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Apply the following option in an environment where a personal computer (not a server computer, such as a laptop) and Wi-Fi with a floating IP address are used. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="lx" label="Linux">

```bash title=SH
echo "ipreg=false" | sudo tee -a /usr/whatap/infra/conf/whatap.conf
sudo service whatap-infra restart
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="wd" label="Windows">

```bash title='SH' {2,3}
// Execute the following command in the powershell with an admin role.
Add-Content "c:\Program Files\WhatapInfra\whatap.conf" "ipreg=false"
Restart-Service "Whatap Infra"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

It can be easily used because it is not automatically registered whenever the IP is changed.
