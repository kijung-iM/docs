The functions of the .NET application server are controlled.

-   **stat_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    The statistics tracing is enabled. The statistical data includes transactions, SQLs, HTTP calls, user agents, and client IPs that are collected every 5 minutes. 

-   **license** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `NONE`

    To install the agent, set the access key granted from the server. The access key includes the agent's project and the encryption key for secured communication.

-   **realtime_user_thinktime_max** <span class='type'>Milliseconds</span>

    Default `300000`

    Set the maximum call interval credited by the same user when measuring the number of real-time browser users.

-   **time_sync_interval_ms** <span class='type'>Milliseconds</span>

    Default `300000`

    Set the synchronization time interval between the agent and the server. For no synchronization, set it to `0`.

-   **text_reset** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `0`

    The WhaTap agent does not transmit the text data once sent until the next day again because it is hashed. If a value is set different from the previous setting, the data is sent again.

    :::note

    Transaction URLs and SQL strings correspond to text data.

-   **profile_method_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    The user functions whose execution time exceeds the value of the `profile_method_time` option can be found in the transaction details.

    :::note

    To apply the set values, restart IIS.

-   **profile_method_time** <span class='type'>Milliseconds</span>

    Default `1000`

    You can set the execution time of the functions to be collected in `profile_method_enabled` option.

    To apply the set values, restart IIS.
