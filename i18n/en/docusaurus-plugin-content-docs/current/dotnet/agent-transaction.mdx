The agent traces the transaction performance and provides the following configurable options.

### Transaction Tracing

{@include: ../common-items/_dotnet-transaction-profile.mdx}

-   **transaction_status_error_enable** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    If an HTTP status code that is not a normal response, such as HTTP 401 or 403, is returned, it is handled as an error.

-   **status_ignore** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set the `STATUS_ERROR` codes to ignore. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

-   **status_ignore_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

    `whatap.error.STATUS_ERROR` is ignored. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

-   **httpc_status_error_enable** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    Determine whether or not to return `HTTPC_ERROR`.

-   **httpc_status_ignore** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set the `HTTPC_ERROR` codes to ignore. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

-   **httpc_status_ignore_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

    `whatap.error.HTTPC_ERROR` is ignored. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

    :::note

    Set it as `httpc_status_ignore_set=/a/b/c:400,/a/ab/c:404`. In Statistics/Error Analysis, enter the value for `HTTPC_URL`.

    :::

-   **profile_http_parameter_keys** <span class='type'>String</span>

    설정된 키에 해당하는 파라미터 정보만 기록합니다. 여러 개를 등록할 때는 쉼표(,)를 구분자로 이용하세요.

-   **trace_active_transaction_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

    Default `3000`

    In the active transaction arc equalizer graph on the dashboard that checks collected data, specify the criteria for the transaction response time that can be recorded as a slow section. If the transaction response time exceeds the set time, the number of slow active transactions is included.

-   **trace_active_transaction_very_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

    Default `8000`

    In the active transaction arc equalizer graph on the dashboard that checks collected data, specify the criteria for the transaction response time that can be recorded as a very slow section. If the transaction response time exceeds the set time, the number of very slow active transactions is included.

-   **trace_active_transaction_lost_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

    Default `30000`

    Timeout waiting for a transaction to end. If a transaction does not end within 5 minutes, no further transaction data is collected. You can see `Lost Connection` in the transaction trace information.
