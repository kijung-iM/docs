The agent traces the transaction performance and provides the following configurable options.

### Transaction Tracing

{@include: ../common-items/_dotnet-transaction-profile.mdx}

### Transaction tracing

-   **trace_active_transaction_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

    Default `3000`

    In the active transaction arc equalizer graph on the dashboard that checks collected data, specify the criteria for the transaction response time that can be recorded as a slow section. If the transaction response time exceeds the set time, the number of slow active transactions is included.

-   **trace_active_transaction_very_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

    Default `8000`

    In the active transaction arc equalizer graph on the dashboard that checks collected data, specify the criteria for the transaction response time that can be recorded as a very slow section. If the transaction response time exceeds the set time, the number of very slow active transactions is included.

-   **trace_active_transaction_lost_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

    Default `30000`

    Timeout waiting for a transaction to end. If a transaction does not end within 5 minutes, no further transaction data is collected. You can see `Lost Connection` in the transaction trace information.
