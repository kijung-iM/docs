### Aggregating the user count

It aggregates the numbers of users who connect to the .NET web application server.

:::note

To apply the value set in the following option, restart IIS.

:::

-   **trace_user_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    Set whether or not to aggregate real-time users. If the user tracing option is set redundantly, the cookie value takes precedence.

-   **trace_user_cookie_keys** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Select the set cookie's value as unique user data. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter. Search in the set order.

-   **trace_user_using_ip** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    It aggregates real-time users based on the IP address. If you want to distinguish users based on the cookie rather than IP addresses, change the value to `false`.
