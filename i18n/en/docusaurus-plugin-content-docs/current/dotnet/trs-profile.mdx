## What is Transaction Tracing?

{@include: ../common-items/_transaction-profile-step.mdx} 

## Detailed analysis

Select **_Analysis_** > **_HITMAP_** and then drag the real-time hitmap to bring up the list of **_TX Trace_**. You can check the transaction information of the selected area in the **_TX Trace_** list. Select an item from the list to see the **_Statistics_** window for the transaction. To analyze the transaction performance, WhaTap collects and displays the properties such as name and client information, the transaction performance, and detailed execution history for each section. Let's take a look at the detailed analysis elements through the **_Statistics_** window.
