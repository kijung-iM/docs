## Checking the service behaviors

Check whether the **_WhaTap.NET_** service is registered normally and it is **_running_**.

With the administrator role, execute the `services.msc` command or double-click the service icon to open the Services administrator.

The **WhaTap .NET** service transfers the collected monitoring data to the WhaTap server. Check the related logs in the _C:\\Program Files\\WhatTap .NET\\logs_ path.
