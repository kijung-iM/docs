### Checking the user's application version

Even if the server environment satisfies the supported version, the .NET monitoring is not supported when the user's application has been developed as a **.NET Core** version instead of **.NET Framework**.

The user's application version can be seen in the **IIS Manager** as follows.

In **IIS Manager**, click **Application Pools**. In the **Application Pools** list, check that **.NET Core** of the pool for your available application is the version 4.0.
