### Setting an account

There are a few things to consider before starting the full-fledged WhaTap monitoring service.

-   **Project**<br/>
    The WhaTap monitoring project means a monitoring unit. To install the agent, first create a project. For more information about the project, see [the following](../project).
-   **Setting the data server region**<br/>
    For sign up, select a data server region. If you select a specific region, user data is stored in the data center belonging to the region. 
-   **Payment Information**<br/>
    A 15-day free trial is available after signing up. To continue using the WhaTap monitoring service after the limit of free trial terms has exceeded, convert to a paid service. For more information about payment, see [the following](../billing).
