Logs are stored in files that record events and messages that occur during application execution. You have to look at the log files to understand the application behaviors and root cause of the issue occurred.

General log monitoring can be checked through the `tail` command or editor after accessing the server. However, it is difficult to use such a simple method in case of an MSA where many applications are distributed or a large number of logs are generated.

Through the WhaTap log monitoring service, you can easily manage or use various and numerous logs.

The Linux `tail` command is mainly used to check the logs whose content is added over time.

## Integrating logs

You have to endure the inconvenience of accessing individual servers through a terminal to check logs displayed on the server. However, if you build the log integration system, you can check the content of logs centrally without accessing individual servers to ensure convenience. By checking the logs on the screen, you can early detect failures by increasing the accessibility to errors and issues. 

Especially in the MSA or Kubernetes environment, log integration can minimize the hassle of accessing individual servers or containers separately. That is why log integration is becoming essential.

Stacking logs on individual servers can excessively increase the file system capacity with the logs. It is required to take measures such as limiting the maximum load capacity so that it does not exceed a specific size. 

If logs are collected centrally, there is no need to keep log files on individual servers. Accordingly, you just need to manage the retention period of central log data.

## Analyzing logs

The logs collected in real time can be viewed on the screen like using the `tail` command. 

For statistical purposes, you can classify logs to see the trend of log counts in specific intervals. If the number of logs occurred is closely related to the failure occurrence time and resolution, this can be checked through the log occurrence trend. 

By registering a log parser, you can quickly search a large number of logs with keywords under specific conditions and search the desired logs.
