To collect logs by your PHP application, check the following:

## Agent Update

It is available from PHP agent 2.3.2. For more information about update, see [the following](../php/agent-update).

## Checking the agent settings

Home > Select Project > **_Log_** > **_Log Setting_**

Select a project in the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, and then select **_Log_** > **_Log Setting_** under Project Menu. Proceed with the process according to the instructions in the **_Check Agent Settings_** tab of the **_Start Log Monitoring_** section.

### Checking the configuration file path

Check the **configuration file path** of the file for log monitoring. You can check it in the CLI environment or on the web.

#### Checking in the CLI environment

```shell
$ php -i | grep 'Scan'
Scan this dir for additional .ini files => /etc/php8.0.d
```

:::note
If the path is "(None)," the configuration file path is _/usr/whatap/php_.
:::

#### Checking on the web

If the PHP settings of the CLI and Apache environments are different, check the results of the `phpinfo()` function on the web.

### Entering the command

Log monitoring starts when you enter the command including the configuration file path.

```shell
export LOGFILES=/some/path/file1,/some/other/file2
echo "whatap.logsink_enabled=true" | sudo tee -a [configuration file path]/whatap.ini
echo "whatap.logsink.files=$LOGFILES" | sudo tee -a [configuration file path]/whatap.ini
```

## Enabling the log monitoring

Home > Select Project > **_Log_** > **_Log Setting_**

You can enable or disable the WhaTap log monitoring with the toggle button in the **_Activate log monitoring_** tab of the **_Starting the log monitoring_** section.
