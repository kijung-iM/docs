To collect logs from your Java application, complete the following 3 steps:

## Agent Update

It is available from Java agent 2.1.1. For more information about update, see [the following](../java/update-agent).

## Checking the agent settings

Home > Select Project > **_Log_** > **_Log Setting_**

Select a project in the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, and then select **_Log_** > **_Log Setting_** under Project Menu. Proceed with the process according to the instructions in the **_Check Agent Settings_** tab of the **_Start Log Monitoring_** section.

1.  Under Project Menu, select **_Management_** > **_Agent CONFIG._**.

2.  In the **_Write Options_** tab, select **_Direct Input_**. Add the `logsink_enabled=true` option in the field. <br/>

3.  Restart the application to apply the log monitoring.

### Key options

-   **hooklog_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
        Default `false`<br/>
        It enables the log monitoring by hooking the log library. 
    :::caution
    Before running the application, this option must have been enabled in _whatap.conf_ to dynamically turn on or off the monitoring through the `logsink_enabled` setting.
    If the `logsink_enabled` option is set to `true` before running the application, log monitoring is possible without a separate setting.
    :::
    :::note
    If there is a possibility to use the log monitoring, it is recommended to set this option in advance.
    :::

-   **logsink_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
        Default `false`<br/>
        It turns on or off Log Monitoring.\
    :::caution
    Before running the application, if in _whatap.conf_, the `hooklog_enabled` option is set, this option can dynamically turn on or off the log monitoring.
    ::: 

-   **logsink_zip_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
      Default `true`<br/>
      It sets whether or not to compress the log data to transfer. 

-   **logsink_trace_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
      Default `false`<br/>
      It sets whether or not to expose the log tab of the transaction trace by adding the transaction ID into the log.
