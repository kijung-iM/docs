The items must be checked after installing the agent. If any problem occurs during installation, see [the following](agent-troubleshooting).

## Agent Log

When the application server runs, it starts collecting the monitoring data.

The locations of logs are created as the following file in the _logs_ directory under `$WHATAP_HOME`. There are two types of log files.

-   _whatap-boot-`yyyymmdd`.log_: Data collection log
-   _whatap-hook.log_: Log for data collection

An example of a normal log is as follows: 

```javascript title=SH
_      ____       ______Python-AGENT
| | /| / / /  ___ /_  __/__ ____
| |/ |/ / _ \/ _ `// / / _ `/ _ \
|__/|__/_//_/\_,_//_/  \_,_/ .__/
                          /_/

```

## Collecting the GraphQL performance data

If the GraphQL library is included in web transactions, the document and latency are collected.

For document-specific performance analysis, set the GraphQL API end point to a transactional exception. After configuration, it automatically uses the `graphql.execute` function as the transaction start point. The transactions are collected that have the name of the object at the top of the document as the service name.
