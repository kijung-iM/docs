It is the network configuration option to communicate with the server for transferring the data collected by the agent.

-   **license** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `true`

    To install the agent, set the access key granted from the server. The access key includes the agent's project and the encryption key for secured communication.

-   **whatap.server.host** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1`

    Set the server to transfer the data collected by the agent. If there are multiple IPs due to the collection server redundancy, they can be specified by separating with comma (_,_). The collection server's proxy daemon must be serviced in the listening state for the specified IP.

-   **whatap.server.port** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `6600`

    Set the collection server's port. Only one port can be specified. The collection servers specified in `whatap_server_host` must use the same port.

-   **net_udp_port** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `6600`

    The WhaTap agent transfers the collected data to the server through UDP and TCP. You can specify the port of the first UDP server. If the provided port 6600 is in use, you can use this option.

-   **tcp_so_timeout** <span class='type'>MiliSecond</span>

    Default `60000`

    Set the socket timeout of the TCP session that communicates with the collection server.

-   **net_send_max_bytes** <span class='type'>Byte</span>

    Default `5242880`

    Maximum data size in bytes the agent can collect and transfer over the network at a time.     

-   **net_send_buffer_size** <span class='type'>Byte</span>

    Default `1024`

    Maximum data in bytes to transfer data.
