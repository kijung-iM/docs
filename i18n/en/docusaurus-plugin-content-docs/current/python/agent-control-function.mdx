The functions of the Python application server are controlled.

-   **enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    All functions are enabled. Even when the value is `false`, the minimum data to maintain communication with the server is sent.

-   **counter_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    The performance counter tracing is enabled. The performance counter includes data such as active transaction, user, CPU, memory, SQL, and external HTTP call. It is ignored when the `enabled` value is `false`.

-   **stat_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    The statistics tracing is enabled. Statistical data such as transactions, SQL queries, external HTTP calls, user agents, and client IPs is collected every 5 minutes, but now the collection is stopped. It is ignored when the `enabled` value is `false`. 

-   **active_stack_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    Enable the active stack tracing.

    :::note

    If the `counter_enabled` value is disabled, the active stacks are not collected because no active transaction data is collected.

    :::

-   **eactive_stack_second** <span class='type'>Seconds</span>

    Default `10`

    Set the interval for tracing the active stacks.

    :::caution

    It is not recommended changing the value.

    :::

-   **realtime_user_thinktime_max** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

    Default `300000`

    Set the maximum call interval credited by the same user when measuring the number of real-time users.

-   **time_sync_interval_ms** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

    Default `300000`

    Set the synchronization interval between the agents and the server. For no synchronization, set it to `0`.  

-   **realtime_user_thinktime_max** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `0`

    The WhaTap agent does not transmit the text data once sent until the next day again because it is hashed. If a value is set different from the previous setting, the data is sent again.

    :::note

    Transaction URLs and SQL strings correspond to text data.
