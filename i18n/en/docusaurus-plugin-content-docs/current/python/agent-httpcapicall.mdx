It provides the options for HTTPC and API calls of the Python agent.

-   **profile_httpc_resource_enabled**<span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
      Default `false`<br/>
      When collecting HTTP call steps from the transaction trace, the CPU and memory usages in the step is traced.

-   **trace_httpc_normalize_enabled**<span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
      Default `true`<br/>
      It enables the function to parse and normalize external HTTPC call URLs. 

-   **trace_httpc_normalize_urls**<span class='type'>String</span><br/>
      It parses and normalizes URLs that call external calls. It parses the call URL patterns to delete the path parameter.<br/>
      For example, if declared as **/a/{v}/b**, **a/123/b** is replaced by **a/{v}/b**. To register multiple items, comma (,) is used as the delimiter. Using /a/\*/b, you can collect after deleting the path parameter with a specific format.
