## What is the project?

In the WhaTap monitoring service, the project means a monitoring unit. In addition to the monitoring unit being divided by project, the tenant role can also be managed.

First, projects are classified by monitoring elements as shown in the figure. The project follows the rules for each monitoring agent, such as application, server, and container.

Second, projects are classified by monitoring units. Even in Java applications, projects can be classified by the purposes, such as Front, Gateway, and API. Of course, you can also register applications without distinction of purpose within a project.
