You can group multiple projects for management. A user can own multiple projects. To manage multiple projects, the concept, "Group" has been provided. If there are multiple projects, it is cumbersome to add users or grant permissions for each project. In this case, you can group two projects into a group and manage users by the group.

:::note

-   A project can belong to a group.
-   A project may not belong to a group.
:::

Project users can inherit group users, and the users can monitor all projects in the group. A user who is granted the role only on the project can monitor only the project, regardless of whether the user is in a group or not.

## Adding a group

1.  Select **_+ Group_** on the upper left of the [WhaTap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io).

2.  Enter the group name to create in **_Group Name_**.

3.  Enter the group description in **_Group Description_**. The field is optional.

4.  Select a project to add to the group in **_Add Project_**. You can search a desired project for addition.

5.  After adding the project, select **_Add Group_**.

:::note
The projects that can be added to the group are the ones with Edit permission or not part of the group.
