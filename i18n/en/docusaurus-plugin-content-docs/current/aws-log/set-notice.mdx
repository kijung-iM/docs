The log events that can be added are as follows:

-   **_Real-time Log Event_**: Alerts are sent when the keyword is found in the logs collected in real time.
-   **_Composite Log Event_**: An alert is sent when more than a specific number of logs that meet conditions, are collected among recently collected logs.

:::note

To add or set an event, you must have the **_alert settings_** role. For more information about the role scheme, see [the following](../project/project-structure#project-group-role-reorganize).

## Common options for event addition

The following are common options that can be set when adding an event.

-   **_Activate Events_**: You can set to enable or disable the alerts by clicking the toggle button.

-   **_Level_**: Select a level among <span class='vslow'>Fatal</span>, <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and <span style={{color: '#757575'}}>Info</span>.

-   **_Event title_**: Enter the name of the event to add.

-   **_Message_**: Enter an alert message to be displayed when an event occurs. You can apply variables to the message by entering `${tag or field key}`. The key to enter into the variable must be a value contained in the selected metric data, **_Category_**.

    If you enter `${logContent}` in a message, the bodies of the collected logs are output as the content of the warning alert.

-   **_Category_**: You can select the log type name (log folder name) from the list or enter it directly.

-   **_Event pause_**: This option can prevent excessive alerts from happening. No alerts are sent for the selected period after the first alert notification is generated. In addition, they are not recorded in **_Event History_**.

-   **_Event Receiving Tag_**: If this tag is selected, notifications can be sent to project members and 3rd-party plug-ins with the corresponding tags. If the event receiving tag is not selected, alerts are sent to all project members.  

    If the tag is not added, alerts are sent to all members. Click **_+ Add Tag_** and then select target alert receivers in **_Tag List_**. You can also select **_+ Create New Tag_** to add new tags.

    :::note

    In **_Alert_** > **_Notification Setting_**, you can set the tags in project members and 3rd-party plug-ins. For more information about **_Notification Setting_**, see [the following](set-receive-event).

## Adding the real-time log event

![](/img/log-alert-event-add.png)

-   **_Keyword search scope_**: The default value of this search key is "All." "All" indicates the log's content.

-   **_Keyword_**: An alert is sent if the log includes the specified word. You can select any in the list and directly enter it.

-   **_Filtering event targets_**: Select values for **_Keyword search scope_**, **_Operator_**, and **_Keyword_** for filtering targets or select **_Direct Input_**. If there is no input, it determines whether or not to generate notifications for all data collected in real time.

    ![](/img/log-alert-event-filter.png)  

    > For example, among the logs in the `AppLog` category, it searches for the logs whose `level` is `ERROR`. Alerts are sent if **_oid_** is **12345678** among matching logs.

## Adding the composite log event

![](/img/log-alert-event-add2.png)

-   **_Event rule condition_**

    -   In **_Keyword search scope_**, you can select any event rule. You can select a keyword that is within the selected **_keyword search scope_**.

    -   If you add an item whose **_keyword search scope_** is the same, the OR condition works. Otherwise, the AND condition works.

    -   You can select **_Exclude_** to exclude the selected keyword from the event rules.

    -   You can select **_+ Add_** to add or exclude multiple event rule conditions.  

-   **_Time Range_**: You can view the logs collected during the selected period. If you select 5 minutes for the data lookup time, the event generation conditions are checked by searching for the data collected for the last 5 minutes.  

-   **_Event rule condition_**: Alerts are sent when events occur as many as the entered number and they occur by meeting the selected operator's condition.

> For example, among the logs in the `AppLog` category, the logs that meet `Enter conditions` are filtered. If **_Exclude_** is checked for condition, it indicates that the logs found under that condition are excluded. Thus, the logs whose `level` is `ERROR` are excluded. Alerts are sent when the event is less than `5` among the logs collected in the last 10 minutes.
