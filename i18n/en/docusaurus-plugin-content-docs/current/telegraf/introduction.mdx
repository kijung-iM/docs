Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems, and IoT sensors. Telegraf has been written in Go, compiles into a single binary file without any external dependency, and requires the minimum memory space.

-   ** Collection and transmission of all types of data**
    -   **Database**
          It collects and sends metrics by connecting data sources such as MongoDB, MySQL, and Redis. 
    -   **System**
          It collects metrics from modern cloud platforms, containers, and orchestrator stacks. 
    -   **IoT Sensor**
          It collects important stateful data (pressure levels, temperature levels, etc.) from IoT sensors and devices.
-   **Telegraf Plug-in**\
      Telegraf is a plug-in driven agent that collects, processes, aggregates, and creates metrics. It supports four categories of plug-ins: input, output, aggregator, and processor.

You can forward the metrics collected by Telegraf to the WhaTap collection server by using the Telegraf's WhaTap output plug-in and installing the WhaTap Telegraf agent.
