Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems, and IoT sensors. Telegraf has been written in Go, compiles into a single binary file without any external dependency, and requires the minimum memory space.

-   ** Collection and transmission of all types of data**

    -   **Database**

        It collects and sends metrics by connecting data sources such as MongoDB, MySQL, and Redis. 

    -   **System**

        It collects metrics from modern cloud platforms, containers, and orchestrator stacks. 

    -   **IoT Sensor**

        It collects important stateful data (pressure levels, temperature levels, etc.) from IoT sensors and devices.

-   **Telegraf Plug-in**

    Telegraf is a plug-in driven agent that collects, processes, aggregates, and creates metrics. It supports four categories of plug-ins: input, output, aggregator, and processor.

You can forward the metrics collected by Telegraf to the WhaTap collection server by using the Telegraf's WhaTap output plug-in and installing the WhaTap Telegraf agent.
