## How to calculate the usage fee of WhaTap products

WhaTap products are using the deferred payment billing. Within 5 business days of each month, you can receive an invoice for the previous month through the email address of the account with the **billing** role. The usage of the previous month is the amount used from the 1st day to the last day of the month. Invoices are created for each account based on the list of paid products registered to the account.

If the subscription period for paid products is in the middle of the month, the period of use is calculated and billed on a pro-rata basis.

## How to pay the usage fee

You can receive an invoice for the previous month's usage within 5 business days of each month. Based on this invoice, you can pay the fee on the [Whatap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io) page by keeping the following procedure:

1.  In the menu on the left of the screen, select **_My Usage_** > **_Invoice & Payment Status_**. You can check the payment status and details.

2.  In case of unpaid status, select **_Pay_**. Then the payment window appears. For example, if you do not pay for your January usage by February 25, your status becomes unpaid.

3.  You can select to pay by credit card or real-time bank transfer.

4.  Click **_Pay_**. Then payment can be completed after going through an authentication process for each payment.
