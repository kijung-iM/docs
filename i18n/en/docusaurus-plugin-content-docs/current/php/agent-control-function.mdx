The PHP application server's functions can be controlled.

-   **whatap.stat_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
    Default `true`<br/>
      It enables the statistical data tracing. The statistical data includes transactions, SQLs, HTTP calls, user agents, and client IPs that are collected every 5 minutes.

-   **whatap.license**<span class='type'>String</span><br/>
    To install the agent, set the access key granted from the server. The access key includes the agent's project and the encryption key for secured communication.

-   **whatap.realtime_user_thinktime_max**<span class='type'>Milliseconds</span><br/>
      Default `300000`<br/>
      Set the maximum call interval credited by the same user when measuring the number of real-time users.

-   **whatap.time_sync_interval_ms**<span class='type'>Milliseconds</span><br/>
    Default `300000`<br/>
    Set the synchronization interval between the agents and the server. For no synchronization, set it to `0`.

-   **whatap.text_reset**<span class='type'>Int</span><br/>
        Default `0`<br/>
        The WhaTap agent does not transmit the text data once sent until the next day again because it is hashed. If the value is set different from the previous setting, the data is sent again.
    :::note
    Transaction URLs and SQL strings correspond to text data.
    :::

-   **whatap.ext.error_enabled**<span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
        Default `true`<br/>
        It activates the function to collect errors from the PHP extension module. If you have a whatap entry in _php.ini_ with a PHP compiled installation, add it to _php.ini_, not _whatap.ini_.
    :::note

    The setting is applied after Apache and PHP-FPM have been restarted.

    :::

-   **whatap.ext.exception_enabled**<span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
        Default `true`<br/>
        It activates the function to collect exceptions from the PHP extension module. If you have a whatap entry in _php.ini_ with a PHP compiled installation, add it to _php.ini_, not _whatap.ini_.
    :::note

    The setting is applied after Apache and PHP-FPM have been restarted.

    :::

-   **whatap.debug_gc_percent**<span class='type'>Int</span><br/>
      Default `200`<br/> 
      It can reduce the CPU load by increasing the interval between GC calls by the whatap-php service daemon. The memory usage increases instead of reducing the CPU load. It applied up to 1000.
