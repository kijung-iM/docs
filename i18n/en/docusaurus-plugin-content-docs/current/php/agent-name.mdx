:::note

-   In WhaTap Monitoring, the object and agent can be used interchangeably as the monitoring target.

:::

The default patterns used to identify the application server are as follows:

```javascript title='object_name 기본 패턴'
{type}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{process}-{dockerid}-{ips}
```

The default pattern can be modified in _whatap.ini_.

| Configuration | Description                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type          | Use the value set in whatap.app_name.                               |
| Ip#           | When IPs are divided by period (.), the #th digit (from 0) is used. |
| process       | Use the value set in whatap.app_name.                               |
| hostname      | The server host name is used.                                       |
| dockerid      | Docker container ID                                                 |
| ips           | Full IP (IPv4, IPv6)                                                |

-   **whatap.object_name**<span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `{type}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{process}`

  The agent naming (ONAME) scheme to identify applications. An OID is created based on the ONAME.

  :::note
  
  The setting is applied after restarting the whatap service. `service whatap-php restart`
  
  :::

-   **whatap.app_name**<span class='type'>String</span>

  The application name used in the agent name (ONAME) scheme to identify applications, which corresponds to the `{type}` of `object_name`.

  :::note
  The setting is applied after restarting the whatap service. `service whatap-php restart`
  :::

-   **whatap.app_process_name**<span class='type'>String</span>
  
  It is the application process name used in the agent naming scheme to identify applications. It sets the target process to collect data of the application server such as CPU and heap memory. It is the value that corresponds to the `{process}` of `object_name`.

  :::note
  The setting is applied after restarting the whatap service. `service whatap-php restart`
