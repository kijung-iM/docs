## Downloading the agent

After getting the **access key**, select your OS running. In the **_Download agent_** section, copy the command for the OS to install the agent.

The PHP agent installation method is **Linux package installation**. You can install it in the following order.

1.  Register the WhaTap **repository**.

2.  Install the whatap-php **Linux package** (yum, apt-get).

3.  Run the **configuration script**. Through the configuration script, the tracer is registered as **PHP extension module**, and the agent runs by the **whatap-php service**.

4.  **Restart** Apache or PHP-FPM.

<details>
<summary>PHP agent file configuration</summary>

The PHP agent file consists of the tracer that extracts data for application monitoring and transfers the data to the WhaTap collection server, the agent that transfers the collected data to the server, and the installation script file that dynamically applies both tracer and agent.

-   _whatap\_`X.Y.Z`.so_

    This library is added as a PHP extension module that has been registered as a tracer to collect data and send the collected data to the agent. The extension modules are classified for each PHP API version and Zend Thread Safe support. Examples are as follows: 

    -   _whatap_zts_20041225.so_  

        PHP 5.2, Zend Thread safe enable

    -   _whatap_20041225.so_

        PHP 5.2, Non Thread Safe 

-   _whatap-php(whatap_php)_

    This program transfers the data delivered from the agent or tracer to UDP, to the collection server.

-   _/etc/init.d/whatap-php_

    Service script file.

-   _whatap_php_

    Service execution file.

-   _whatap.ini_

    In this file, the settings of the PHP extension module that collects data of the application server, the collection server address, and the project access key of the server are entered.

-   _template.ini_ 

    The template file is copied when creating _whatap.ini_.

-   _whatap-install-`yyyymmdd`.log_

    Log file generated during installation. The default storage path is _/usr/whata/php/logs_. The files are created by date. Only the logs for 7 days are kept by default.

-   _whatap-boot-`yyyymmdd`.log_

    Agent log file. The default storage path is _/usr/whata/php/logs_. The files are created by date. Only the logs for 7 days are kept by default.

-   _install.sh_

    Installation script. Proceed with the whatap-php service installation by installing the PHP extension module (_whatap.so_) to Apache or PHP-FPM. For more information, see [the following](agent-troubleshooting#extension-modul-manual-setting).

-   _WhaTap.php (sample.php)_

    API reference class (_/usr/whatap/php/lib/WhaTap.php_) to be used in the PHP source code, and the example source file (_sample.php_)
