This document explains how to find problems of the web application server and response to failures by using the **_Hitmap Transaction_** among the [WhaTap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io) functions. 

The staff of Application Monitoring has different items to monitor depending on the field of work. Server administrators monitor resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network, and want to know how much they are using. DB staff wants to see the metrics to improve the DB query performance. 

On the other hand, in the traditional monitoring methods, the service (AP) staff only checks heap usage and CPU usage. However, in this way, it is not possible to know what the problem is with the service (AP). The most important thing in the service (AP) is whether to respond to user requests properly, quickly, and without errors. For this purpose, we need to verify that the user request has been properly performed. Each user request is called "request," and the process to handle this request in the server and respond to the request is defined as **transaction**. 

In the WhaTap monitoring service, you can see the failure status of the service (AP) by dividing transactions into "transactions in progress" and "completed transactions." In the **_Hitmap_** widget of **_Application Dashboard_**, you can check individual completed transactions in a distribution chart. A hitmap chart is the widget that collects transaction data that ended at an interval of 5 seconds and expresses them in dots. Through this chart, we can analyze the causes of failures by finding the transactions that should take 1 second took around 2 seconds, more than twice the response time.

## Pattern Analysis

Let's look at how to determine which type of failure has occurred depending on the shape of the distribution chart.

**_HITMAP Transaction_** is the chart that displays the response time to user requests in a distribution chart over time. In **_Application Dashboard_**, select ![Right arrow icon](/img/right-arrow.svg) at the upper right of the hitmap widget to enter the **_Hitmap Transaction_** menu.

![Hitmap Transaction](/img/best-p/best-p-hitmap-transaction.png)

The horizontal axis is the transaction end time, and the vertical axis is the response time. The response times to the user requests appear as rectangles on the chart for each time the transactions end. This allows you to determine whether the user request has been properly responded to. The colors of the square boxes on the hitmap transaction chart have the following meanings.

-   <span class='normal'>Blue</span>: Normal transaction
-   <span class='slow'>Orange</span>: Transactions with the response times as slow as 8 seconds
-   <span class='vslow'>Red</span>: Transaction with the response time of more than twice as slow or transactions rejected

The most important part to look at in this chart is where the transaction boxes are lined up horizontally or vertically. See the following hitmap pattern.

<div class='pattern-intro'>

<div class='pattern-img'>

![Vertical line pattern](https://www.whatap.io/ko/blog/113/img/blog_03.webp)

</div>

<div>

**Pattern in which vertical lines appear temporarily**. If a vertical line occurs, it indicates that the response times of each transaction are different, but the end times are the same. If a lock occurs temporarily during processing the transactions, the transaction process is queued. When the lock is released, the queued transactions are terminated all at once in a similar time. This situation creates vertical lines.

![Horizontal line pattern](https://www.whatap.io/ko/blog/113/img/blog_04.webp)

</div>

<div>

**Pattern with horizontal lines**. In a 10 second timeout condition, if the resource is insufficient, many transactions wait for 10 seconds and then generate timeout errors. At this time, a horizontal line appears near 10 seconds of the hitmap. If there is a logic to retry after timeout, the horizontal lines repeat every 10 seconds as shown in the figure above.

<div>

**Flying pattern that looks like waves** is the pattern that appears at intervals due to lack of specific resources or common resources such as logs.

![Overload pattern](https://www.whatap.io/ko/blog/113/img/blog_06.webp)

</div>

<div>

**Overload pattern** is the pattern that occurs when there is a high concentration of transactions that is temporarily caused by some or all of the response failures.

![Flood pattern](https://www.whatap.io/ko/blog/113/img/blog_07.webp)

</div>

<div>

**Flood pattern** is the pattern in which the overall response times increase upon excessive transaction requests or loads.

When a pattern occurs, it is important to determine whether the factor of the server causing the pattern is internal or external. Assume that you have designed your system with the structure shown in the following figure.

![](/img/best-p/hitmap-transaction-sample.png)

In the lower part of the chart, there are mostly transactions with fast response times. Accordingly, finding patterns is meaningless. You have to find common factors of the pattern caused in the slow section of the above area. When a vertical line pattern occurs and a lock occurs in the service (AP), the pattern occurs only in a web application. On the contrary, if a lock occurs in an externally connected database, the pattern occurs in all web applications. 

If you drag the chart area, the transaction information of the dragged area appears in the **_TX Trace_** list at the bottom. You can also find the source of the problem through the **_Agent Name_** column. The **_Application_** widget on the right also groups agents and displays them in a list.

Because we are intended to find common factors of failures, first check whether problems have occurred in the same application or URL. Otherwise, you can also check whether the client IPs are the same.

## Analysis of sections and stacks

How can we check if the cause of failure is an internal issue rather than an external one? WhaTap uses the technology called **Active Stack** to collect stack data of active transactions. Stack data is collected every 10 seconds, and the collected data can be checked in the statistics. It also includes the data of each method, SQL, and external call that perform the service logic. 

If it is an internal problem, you can find and solve any problem by checking the execution history of transactions over time and identifying the slowdown section. If it is an external problem, you can check the SQL and external call data.

For example, to find any factor that causes a lock in a vertical line pattern, check the contact points between the slowest transaction and the fastest transaction in the same pattern. Drag the area where the pattern occurs on the hitmap chart. The **_TX Trace_** list displays the transactions of the area dragged to the list. Sort the **_TX traces_** by the elapsed time, and then select the transaction that took the longest. The **_Statistics_** window displays information details of the selected transaction.

![](/img/best-p/hitmap-transaction-sample-02.png)

In the **_Table View_** tab, you can check the **_section time_** and **_step time_**. **_Section time_** is the time when each step started or ended, and **_step time_** is the total time from the start to the end of each method. **_Gap_** is the interval between executed methods.

You can find the slowdown section in the **_Table View_** tab. In the same way, check the slowdown section in the fastest transaction. You may find any common factor. If the slowdown was caused by the service (AP) logic, check the **_active stack_**. If you select **_Active Stack_**, the detailed information window appears. See the step number to correlate the **_active stack_** with the previously executed method. Check this number after clicking the **_Tree View_** tab. Because it is not possible to see the start time of the method using only the **_Tree View_** tab, check the **_section time_** first in the **_Table View_** tab.

:::note

-   **Active stack** saves snapshots every 10 seconds, so you can check them at any section. Because the probability increases when identifying the section where the response time can be long, you can find the point where the section has been widened through the **active stack**.
-   In the **_TX trace_** list, the transactions that include the **active stack** displays the <span class='mark active'>A</span> icon.

:::

If you see the transactions in the hitmap chart, you can find the related transactions. By checking the transactions, find the factors that affect the response time or end time. By tracing all methods in the application, you can perform section analysis, but it may cause distortion in the response time, resulting in overhead. That is why you must only trace the selected class methods. This selection is determined only from the administrator's point of view, but locks and other factors causing failures can be excluded. The **active stack** technology assists this weak point. 

WhaTap monitoring service repeatedly snapshots the **active stack** to find recurring problems while running the application server. This helps find the key factor causing failures with a high probability. **_Analysis_** > **_Stack_** is the menu that can statistically check the collected data. For more information about the stack, see [the following](https://docs.whatap.io/java/analysis-apm).

-   Select **_More_** at the upper right of the **_Statistics_** window to expand for the basic transaction data. Errors, client IP, used devices, OS, country information, and such are provided. You can also see how many calls are being used by looking at the number and times of patches, the number and times of SQLs, and more.
-   The graph that has summarized the above data is the **_diagram_** chart located in the center of the screen. For more information, see [the following](https://docs.whatap.io/java/trs-profile).

## Analysis of call relationship

-   **_Methods_**

    Select **_Methods_** tab of the **_Statistics_** window. Like SQL, you can also see how many times a method was called within a single transaction. 

    ![](/img/best-p/hitmap-transaction-sample-05.png)

    Based on this information, you can check whether there are methods that have been repeatedly executed and the same method has been called repeatedly to find improvements.

-   **_SQLs_**

    Let's look at the case where the cause of failure is SQL, not internal logic. To see the SQL executions statistically within a single transaction, select the **_SQLs_** tab of the **_Statistics_** window.

    ![](/img/best-p/hitmap-transaction-sample-04.png)

    Check how many times the same SQL has been called. Find the way to reduce the burden on the DB by decreasing the number of calls in the logic or find another workaround. Reducing the burden on the database is very important for server operation. The application server can be scale out. You can continuously increase the resources. On the other hand, splitting a database entails a huge amount of application redevelopment. The basis of performance tuning should be in the direction of reducing the burden on the database in the application as much as possible. 

-   **_HTTP Calls_**

    Select the **_HTTP Calls_** tab of the **_Statistics_** window. It provides the number of calls, total time, and average time for HTTP calls.

-   **Multi-transaction**

    The monolithic environment has a single APM configuration. In this case, check only the transactions for the APM. Recently, the technology like microservice architecture has become mainstream. Because a single APM is broken down into smaller chunks, the transactions that must be collected also increase. In this case, collecting all the splitted transactions takes much load, so the transactions related to a targeet transaction are also collected together. The transactions linked to other APMs are defined by WhaTap as **multi-transaction**. In the **_TX trace_** list, the transactions that include **multi-transactions** display the <span class='mark multi'>M</span> icon.

    ![](/img/best-p/hitmap-transaction-sample-07.png)

    Select **_Multi TX Chart_** in the **_Statistics_** window. The linked data for each transaction can be checked in a chart. If you select the **_Multi TX Table_** tab, you can see the detailed information.

    :::note

    -   For more information about the multi-transaction trace, see [the following](https://docs.whatap.io/java/trs-multi-trace).
    -   Depending on the transaction, the **_Multi TX Table_** tab may not be available.

## Analysis of transaction logs

![](/img/best-p/hitmap-transaction-sample-06.png)

 In the **_Transaction Log_** tab of the **_Statistics_** window, you can also find further improvements through the logs left while the transaction is running.

## Finishing

Check the patterns and common factors in **_Hitmap Transaction_**. Analyze the method section through the identified common factors. If the section information is insufficient, obtain additional information through **Active Stack**. Then check the SQLs, methods, and HTTP calls to find improvements for repetitive and burdensome logics. Through the **_Hitmap Transaction_** of the WhaTap monitoring service, you can improve the efficiency for monitoring to the next level.
