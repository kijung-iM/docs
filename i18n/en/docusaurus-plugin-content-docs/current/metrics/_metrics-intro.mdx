## What is the metrics?

WhaTap collects data from monitoring targets and provides them to users. The data collected from agents is called **metrics**.

</div>

**Metrics** consists of the following components:

-   **_Category_**: A group of related metrics
-   **_Tags_**: Data containing unique identifiers to find the targets to collect
-   **_Fields_**: Metrics collected from the agent
-   **_Time_**: Time when the metric has been collected
-   **_Oid_**: Unique number of the agent that has collected metrics

For example, the `app_counter` is a category that contains data for transactions. In this case, you can view the transaction related metrics by querying the `app_counter` category.

Looking at the `app_counter` sample data, we can see that tags and fields have been collected from both agents (-1012315416, 1664920292) at the same time (2021-11-17 13:57:15).

## Viewing the metrics chart

**_Project Menu_** > **_Analysis_** > **_Metrics Chart_**

After selecting the project in **_Project List_**, select **_Metrics Chart_** from **_Analyze_**. You can view the metric data collected from the monitoring target as a chart.

<!-- 모니터링 대상으로부터 수집된 **메트릭스**들은 차트로 표현될 수 있습니다. -->

Looking at an example metrics chart screen, you can check the metrics (TPS) collected from the monitoring targets (6373-8074, 6374-8071) on a chart at the set time. At this time, the collection server uses the `app_counter` category metric that has TPS value of the selected metric, as a field.

Metrics from the categories that have metric values as fields are used.
