WhaTap URL Monitoring provides services for determining whether the website access is normal from the end user's point of view. From the user's point of view, the WhaTap monitoring agent accesses the site and provides whether the connection is normal, instead of checking whether the website is normally accessed through the browser. For access to the website, the server where WhaTap's check agent is installed will attempt connection. As the result of access test, the response code and time for the HTTP call are provided. 

You can use all functions of the WhaTap URL monitoring service free of charge without limiting the count. Start checking your websites after registering the websites to monitor.
