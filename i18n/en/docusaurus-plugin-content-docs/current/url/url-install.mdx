    -   **_Name_**: Used as a unique identification for URL settings. Duplicates are not allowed, and if you register with the same name when resetting, statistical data with the name will be considered as data from the same URL.

### Selecting a region

We can provide additional regions for future connectivity testing. For additional regions, contact us at support@whatap.io.

For **access testing to a closed network site**, you may need to open the firewall to allow calls from the agent. The location IP address is displayed as a help. The **Firewall open target IP addresses** of each agent are as follows.

-   AWS-Seoul-Agent - 54.180.11.176
-   AWS-Tokyo-Agent - 18.179.189.142

-   AWS-Mumbai-Agent - 3.6.243.66
-   AWS-Frankfurt-Agent - 18.197.22.141
-   AWS-California-Agent - 54.215.76.203

If **cloudflare** is used, you must allow the **region IPs that are compatible with its firewall rules**.

-   AWS-Seoul-Agent - 54.180.11.176
-   AWS-Tokyo-Agent - 18.179.189.142
