URL Monitoring can be provided with alerts in the form of emails through event settings. The project monitoring screen also provides notifications for real-time events. You can set individual events for the registered URLs as follows. 

1.  In the event list screen, select ![Edit icon](/img/ico-edit.svg) **_Edit_** for the URL to edit.

    Event rules such as **_status_** and **_elapsed time_** are set by combining the monitoring metrics and conditional expressions. 

    -   **Status events**

        The status event occurs depending on the selected **_Status_** code option.

    -   **Elapsed time event**

        The elapsed time event occurs when the **_Elapsed Time_** collected in real time meets the entered threshold and condition.

:::note 

**What is Alert Message?**

It is the title to be displayed when an event occurs by the rule. Notification messages can be set for each event rule. When no setting is applied, the displayed notification message is **_Status Code_**, **_Elapsed Time_**, and **_URL: Detail_** by default.
