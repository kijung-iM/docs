AJAX is short for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It refers to using the `XMLHttpRequest` object to communicate with the server. 

AJAX is an important data loading method to construct a dynamic screen among resource data. If AJAX is not called normally, the normal screen cannot be provided to end users. The collected data can help us identify what hinders the user experience.
