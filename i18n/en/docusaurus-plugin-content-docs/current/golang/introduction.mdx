WhaTap Golang Application Monitoring provides the monitoring service for the Golang applications.

-   It continuously collects data from the Go Runtime package. It also collects data including memory, goroutine, and GC related data.
-   When multiple API/RPC services are called in the MSA environment, the call relationships are collected through link tracing.
