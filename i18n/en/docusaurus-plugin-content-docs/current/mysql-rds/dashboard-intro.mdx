**_Dashboard_** is the function that allows you to grasp the overall status of the project that changes in real time. **Instance** indicates the database connected through agent installation. In **_Instance List_**, you can check the status of all instances registered in the project. In **_Instance Monitoring_**, you can monitor individual instance performance metrics and active sessions in a more diverse way. **_Multi-instance monitoring_** allows you to see metrics and active sessions of multiple instances at a glance.

-   It is structured for you to understand the status of the database and key performance metrics at a glance. Performance metrics are updated at collection intervals (5 seconds).
-   You can check running active sessions (including queries), locks, and process data. Default metrics are searched by query, so they are not limited by OS or cloud environment. You need to additionally install the XOS agent to view OS process information and some system resource metrics.
-   It provides the function to analyze the real-time monitoring data at a specific point of time by saving all monitoring data.

## Instance List

You can see the list of database servers in which the agent has been installed. You can check key performance metrics and status for each instance. The performance metrics are updated every 5 seconds, and the order of the columns and the metrics in the list can be changed through settings. For more information, see [the following](instance-list).

## Instance Monitoring

You can monitor detailed information of key metrics of the database server, active sessions, and lock trees in real time. You can also see alerts that could be problematic. Collected data is updated every 5 seconds. For more information, see [the following](instance-monitoring).
