Based on the collected data, the function to analyze the overall trend for a specified day. It compares the performance trends through comparison databases for different days. You can analyze delayed queries by finding active sessions at specific points.

You can analyze the trend of locks during the day. The session that caused a lock (Lock Holder) and the session waiting for a lock (Lock Waiter) can be checked through a tree structure. Through these functions, you can analyze queries by checking the relationship between holders and waiters for locks that occurred at specific points.

## Lock tree

Home > Select Project > **_Analysis_** > **_Lock Tree_**

It provides the time series chart and lock tree for the locks occurred during the day. From the point where a lock first occurred, the structure of holders and waiters is displayed in a tree form. You can check the rock tree over time.

For more information about the lock tree analysis, see the following video clip.

### Basic usage guide

![Lock tree](/img/db-locktress-basic.png)

Set the desired ![number1](/img/number-01.png) date and time, and then select an instance from the ![number2](/img/number-02.png) list. If a lock occurs at the set time, **_lock wait sessions_** and the retrieved data appear in the table at the bottom of the screen.

-   If you click a specific time in the graph chart, you can check the lock information for the selected time in the table at the bottom of the screen. If you select the button at the bottom, you can see the lock information in 5-second increments.
-   If you drag a specific time on the graph chart, you can enlarge the selected area and check the lock information. In the same way, if you click a specific time, you can search the lock information of the selected time in the table at the bottom of the screen.

### Column information

The following are descriptions of the columns in the table at the bottom of the screen.

## Dead lock

Home > Select Project > **_Analysis_** > **_Dead Lock_**

![Deadlock](/img/db-deadlock-basic.png)

You can check information about deadlocks that have occurred in the database.

1.  Set the time to search in **_Time_**.

2.  Select an instance name to view in **_instance_**.

3.  Select ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png).

It provides deadlock information in the form of table.

:::note

You can select a lookup time (up to 3 weeks). Select the clock display area to query a random date and time. If you click the date and time text area, the selectable options for the date and time appear.

## Database parameters

Home > Select Project > **_Analysis_** > **_Database Parameter_**

It provides the function to query the current database settings. Database setting values of the current time are provided by default, and the previous setting values can also be viewed. You can check the differences by the comparison function. If a failure occurs, it is easy to see whether the settings have changed compared to the previous data.

For more information about **_Database Parameter_**, see the following video clip.

### Basic usage guide

![Database Parameter](/img/db-database-parameter-basic.png)

1.  Set the **_reference date_**. Today is set by default.

2.  Set the **_comparison date_** for comparison.

3.  In the **_instance_** list, select an instance to query database settings.

4.  Select ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png).

You can compare the settings between the reference date and the target date side by side. Items with different settings appear in <span class='vslow'>red</span>. To see only the changes, select **_View Changes_**.
