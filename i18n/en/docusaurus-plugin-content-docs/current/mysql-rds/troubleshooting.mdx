If the connection fails in the **Entry of DB information** step, see the following to troubleshoot the problem.

## Resource cleanup after connection failure

If DB information has been entered incorrectly or the firewall has not been opened, the following message appears.

1.  Select **_Delete failed agent_** to clean up the agent resources.

2.  The Delete operation proceeds with the message, `***Deleting agent that failed to create.***`.

3.  After completing the deletion, the **Entry of DB information** screen appears again.

See the message including the cause of the connection failure and then resolve the problem.
