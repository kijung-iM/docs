By default, the collected data for the last 10 minutes is retrieved in real time. If you select values in **_Time_** and **_Instance_**, the collected data is automatically applied to the ![number2](/img/number-02.png) graph chart and ![number4](/img/number-04.png) **_active session_** table.

-   To view the past data, click the green button and then select the desired lookup time. You can search data up to the last 3 weeks.
