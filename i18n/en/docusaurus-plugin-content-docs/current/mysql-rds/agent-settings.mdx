In MySQL RDS, unlike the existing [MySQL product](../mysql/agent-settings), the agent is located in the WhaTap resources. Accordingly, it can be set directly on the WhaTap monitoring service screen. Select a project on Home screen, and then select **_Management_** > **_Agent CONFIG._**. You can set the agent options.

:::note

In **_Agent CONFIG._**, only members with the **Edit** role can set options.

## Adding options

1.  In **_Agent List_**, select an agent to change the agent settings in.

2.  In **_Write Options_**, select **_Select Option_**.

3.  Select a desired option.

    To add any option, click **_Add_** and then select the following option.

4.  Select **_Apply_** on the upper right of the screen. 

Restart the agent to apply the changes.

## Agent CONFIG. option{#agent-option}

It is the description of the option that can be set on the agent that collects data from the database server. 

-   **deadlock_interval** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `60`

    Set the interval (unit: minute) to fetch the deadlock data. For deadlock information, only the latest deadlock information that occurred during the set interval is retrieved.

-   **tables_hour** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `20`

    Set the collection time (based on UTC) to store the table data. By default, it is collected at 20:00 UTC that is 5:00 AM in Korea.

-   **tables_min_row** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `10000`

    When collecting the table information, table data with the number of rows smaller than the set value is not collected.

-   **replication_name** <span class='type'>String</span>

    If you set the replication name, it is considered that there is a Master/Slave relationship between DBs with the same `replication_name`.

-   **skip_whatap_session** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `0`

    If you set `1`, the session in which the query to collect from WhaTap operates, does not appear in the active session list. (Default value: 0)

-   **skip_sys_session** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `1`

    If set to `2`, the sys sessions (root, system user, event_scheduler) are not visible in the active session. The set value, `1` makes sys sessions visible, but excludes them from the total runtime.

### Sharing the agent settings

Agent settings can be saved as a json file, and the file can be loaded and applied to other agents.

1.  In the **_agent list_**, select an agent to export the settings to a json file.

2.  On the upper right of the screen, select ![Export icon](/img/ico-export.svg). 

3.  Download the json file.

4.  In **_Agent List_**, select other agents. 

5.  On the upper right of the screen, select ![Import icon](/img/ico-import.svg).

Check the agent settings fetched from the json file.

## Initialization

To add options or reset changes, select ![Refresh icon](/img/ico-refresh.svg) on the upper right of the screen.

## Agent list filtering

If you have many agents connected to your project, you can find the desired agent by selecting Search or sorting method in **_Agent List_**.

-   In **_Agent Search_**, enter the name of the desired agent. It automatically updates the list of agents matching the entered text.

-   To check only the list of agents connected to the DB, select the checkbox of **_Active Agents_**. 

-   Select **_Select Column_** to sort the list of agents by name, port, agent version, etc. The list of agents is sorted by the selected column. Select a table header to change the sorting order.

-   To reset the criteria set above, select ![Refresh icon](/img/ico-refresh.svg) next to **_Agent List_**.
