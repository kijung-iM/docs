Before you start monitoring, check the database support versions, agent architectures, installation requirements, and more. 

WhaTap MySQL RDS monitoring service can start monitoring as soon as database is connected. Select your product and create a project. If you enter the DB connection information, the DB agent is created on the WhaTap server and required settings are automatically performed. After configuration, the agent starts automatically and collects monitoring data. Therefore, it is required to allow access to the customer DB from the WhaTap collection server. Transmission of collected data uses SSL communication for security. RDS must be located on the Public subnet and must allow access from the WhaTap collection server.

## Supported versions for the database

-   The **MySQL RDS** product is recommended for use only with **AWS RDS DB** that guarantees SSL communication between the DBX agent and the DB section.
-   It supports all versions (5.7 to 8.0) of **AWS RDS MySQL** and all versions (10.3 to 10.6) of **AWS RDS MariaDB**.

## Architecture composition

The existing [MySQL monitoring](https://docs.whatap.io/mysql/monitoring-intro) products require the collection agent to be installed in the customer network. On the other hand, with **MySQL RDS**, the DB agent (DBX) is located on the WhaTap server. In the environment where only DB access is possible, the agent is automatically installed and monitoring is started. For this purpose, firewall settings are required.

## Firewall

To connect the DB server and the WhaTap collection server, the firewall must be opened on the DB server and any external access and access to the DB must be allowed. Thus, **AWS RDS DB** to be monitored must be located in the **public subnet** and the security group must allow access to the WhaTap server.

-   Source: **54.180.11.176**
-   Target: Port of the monitoring target DB

:::note

If any of the following is applicable, use the existing [MySQL monitoring](https://docs.whatap.io/mysql/monitoring-intro) product.

-   In case RDS is in the private subnet
-   In case external access to the DB is not allowed

## Security

WhaTap has strengthened two aspects of security to protect customer data. Transmission of collected data uses SSL communication. DB access data is encrypted and stored on the WhaTap server by applying a 3rd-party solution (Vault).
