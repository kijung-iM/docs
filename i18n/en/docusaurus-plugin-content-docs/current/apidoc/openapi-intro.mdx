To extract the monitoring data being collected and use it separately, the function to extract data is provided through Open API. You can obtain the collected data by passing the account API token, project API token, and project code as parameters.

## Checking the open API token

Tokens are divided into account API tokens and project API tokens. The account API token is used to acquire the project list, and the project API token is used to acquire project monitoring data.

You can check the project code through the data displayed like "[{project code}] Cloud Application Monitoring" in the window or tab title at the top of the browser screen when entering the project. To change the API token, select **_Reissue_** or **_Reissue Token_** on each screen.

### Checking the account token

1.  Select the profile icon on the upper right of the screen.

2.  If a pop-up menu appears, select **_Manage Account INFO._**.

3.  Scroll down the screen, go to the **_API Token_** section.

### Checking the project token

1.  Select a project in the Home screen. 

2.  After entering the project, select **_Management_** > **_Project Management_** on the left.

3.  Check the **_API Token_**.
