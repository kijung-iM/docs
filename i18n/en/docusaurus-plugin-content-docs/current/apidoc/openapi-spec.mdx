## Account API

In case of the open APIs that exceed the scope of the project's authority such as project list lookup, use the account API token to call.

The content included in the header upon open API call is as follows:

| Type   | Key              | Set value  | Remarks                                                                                                                    |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Header | `x-whatap-token` | API token  | Account API token: Select the profile icon on the upper right of the screen > **_Manage Account INFO._** > **_API Token_** |

Items that can be called with the open API for meta-information lookup are as follows. For more information about the open API call usage, see [the following](openapi-call-meta).

-   Viewing the project list
-   Viewing the project member list
-   View User Group List
-   Viewing the group member list
-   Viewing the project in the group

## Project API

For open APIs within the scope of project authority, the calls are made using the project API token along with the project code.

The content included in the header upon open API call is as follows:

| Type   | Key            | Set value | Remarks                                                                                             |
| ------ | -------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Header | x-whatap-token | API token | Project API Token: Select a project > **_Management_** > **_Project Management_** > **_Api Token_** |
| ^      | x-whatap-pcode | pcode     | Check in the window or browser tab title <br/>`[{project code}]` Cloud Application Monitoring       |

### Viewing the meta information

Items that can be called with the open API for meta-information lookup are as follows. For more information about the open API call usage, see [the following](openapi-call-meta#project-info).

-   Viewing the project information (Application product suite)
-   Viewing the project information and server details (Server product suite)
-   Viewing the project agent status and host

-   Inactive agent count
-   Host count
-   Sum of CPU cores of the host
-   Transaction count
-   Transactions per second
-   Unique user count aggregated for 5 minutes
-   Active transaction count

-   CPU Utilization
-   Sum of disk IOPS
-   Sum of network traffic (IN/OUT)
-   Process status
-   Server List
-   Server monitoring details
-   Server statistics details

### Viewing the statistical data

The open API for viewing the statistical data is called by setting a time range, and if the following items are included in the URL, the operation method is as follows.

-   Data is searched for the last 5 minutes if the time range is not specified.
-   `stime`: Lookup start time (UNIX epoch time, millisecond)
-   `etime`: Lookup end time (UNIX epoch time, millisecond)

:::note
`etime` cannot exceed 1 day based on `stime`.
:::

-   oids: You can set multiple values using comma (,) as the delimiter.
-   The included "/avg" in the URL means averaging per agent.

Items that can be called with the open API for statistical data lookup are as follows. For more information about the open API call usage, see [the following](openapi-call-apm-stat-data).

-   Occurrence of exception
-   HTTP outbound call
-   Client IP
-   Issuing SQL
-   Transactions
-   Thread count
-   Thread daemon count
-   Thread peak count
-   Thread pool count
-   Thread pool queue count
-   Transaction call statistics between projects
-   Domain call statistics
-   Active users (5-minute increment)
-   Active users (1-hour increment)

### Viewing the project statistics

The open API for viewing the project statistics merges and views the data collected through multiple agents in a single project. You can call it by setting a time range.

-   If no time range is set, the most recent data is retrieved.
-   `stime`: Lookup start time (UNIX epoch time, millisecond)
-   `etime`: Lookup end time (UNIX epoch time, millisecond)<br/>
    If only the `etime` value is given, the data of 5 seconds before is retrieved based on the time.
-   `timeMerge`: When setting the lookup start and end times, strategy for merging temporal data (Average: `avg`, Maximum value: `max`, Minimum value: `min`)

:::note

-   `etime` cannot exceed 1 day based on `stime`.
-   If `etime` has been set, `stime` can add `timeMerge` (time merging strategy) as an option. If you do not add the time merge strategy, the default merge strategy is averaging.

Items that can be called with the open API for project statistics lookup are as follows. For more information about the open API call usage, see [the following](openapi-call-project-stat).

-   TPS in the project
-   Average response time in the project
-   Average CPU utilization in the project
-   DB connection counts for each data source in the project

### Viewing the long-term statistical information

The open API for viewing the long-term statistics has a time setting range depending on the type. You can set a time range and call it. If the following items are included in the URL, the behaviors are as follows.

-   `stime`: Lookup start time (UNIX epoch time, millisecond)
-   `etime`: Lookup end time (UNIX epoch time, millisecond)

:::note
액티브 사용자는 1일 단위 그리고 1개월 단위로 집계됩니다. 

-   Active users (1-day increment): `etime` cannot exceed 31 days based on `stime`.
-   Active users (1-month increment): `etime` cannot exceed 365 days based on `stime`.

For more information about the open API call usage, see [the following](openapi-call-long-stat).

### Viewing the short-term information

The data is viewed in the set time. If the time has not been set, the latest data is retrieved. It is searched by the project, and the agent data is automatically merged. The query string is used. Each query string can be used in conjunction with "&." Available query strings are as follows:

-   `stime`: Lookup start time (UNIX epoch time, millisecond)
-   `etime`: Lookup end time (UNIX epoch time, millisecond)
-   `timeMerge`: `avg`, `min`, `max`, and `sum` can be used with the time merge setting.

Items that can be called with the open API for short-term lookup are as follows. For more information about the open API call usage, see [the following](openapi-call-short-stat).

-   Transaction count
-   Average response time
-   Average CPU utilization
-   Active/inactive DB connection count
