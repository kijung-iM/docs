The following options are related to the statistics collection for the data collected by the agent.

-   **mtrace_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
    Default `false`<br/>It sets whether or not to use the multi-transaction tracing (MTID). By tracing the MTID, you can check the calls between all the registered applications.

-   **stat_domain_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
    Default `false`<br/>
    It enables the function to collect transaction statistics for each domain that connects to clients.

-   **stat_mtrace_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
    Default `false`<br/>
    It enables the function to collect call statistics between services in the MSA architecture. If the value is `true`, it delivers its own data upon outbound call.
