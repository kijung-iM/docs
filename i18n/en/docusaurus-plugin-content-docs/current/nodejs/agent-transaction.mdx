The agent traces the transaction performance and provides the following configurable options.

### Transaction Tracing

{@include: ../common-items/_transaction-profiling-common.mdx}

{@include: ../common-items/_transaction-profile-active-color.mdx}

-   **hook_method_patterns** <span class='type'>String</span>

    It sets the method to measure the response time. Class full names and methods are separated by the period (.) as the delimiter, and asterisk (\*) can be used as the wildcard. In case of multiple items, comma (,) is used as the delimiter.

    ```ini title='Example'
    hook_method_patterns=a.b.C1.*
    ```

-   **hook_method_access_public_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the public methods as separate targets.

-   **hook_method_access_protected_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the protected methods as separate targets.

-   **hook_method_access_private_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the private methods as separate targets.

-   **hook_method_access_none_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the no access indicated methods as separate targets.

-   **hook_method_ignore_prefixes** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `get,set`

    When setting a method trace, it sets the classes to exclude from the trace with a prefix.

-   **hook_method_ignore_classes** <span class='type'>String</span>

    When setting a method trace, it sets the classes to exclude from the trace.

### HTTP transaction tracing

{@include: ../common-items/_transaction-trace-common.mdx}

{@include: ../common-items/_transaction-profile-http.mdx}

-   **trace_ignore_url_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

    It sets URLs to exclude from transaction tracing. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

-   **trace_ignore_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

    It sets URL prefixes to exclude from transaction tracing. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

### Non-HTTP transaction tracing

-   **hook_service_patterns** <span class='type'>String</span>

    It sets the start point pattern for non-HTTP transaction tracing.

-   **trace_background_socket_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    When a socket (TCP) connection is opened, this open is traced only in transaction start status. This tracing is made when the socket is opened by a background thread rather than a transaction.

### Transaction tracing

-   **trace_service_port_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    Add the port number to the transaction name.

### Multiple transaction trace

-   **mtrace_rate** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `0`

    This option sets the rate of the MTID (Multi Transaction ID) issued when the first transaction occurs. It can be set from `0` to `100`. By tracing the MTID, you can check calls between all registered applications. For the applications belonging to the same project, you can check transaction traces immediately through the Caller & Callee function.

-   **mtrace_spec** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default: `v1`

    Set the application version of the current instance. You can arbitrarily enter a string. This data is used for call statistics.

-   **mtrace_caller_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `x-wtap-mst`

    Set the caller key name to be used for MTID tracing.

-   **mtrace_callee_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `x-wtap-tx`

    Set the callee key name to be used for MTID tracing.

-   **mtrace_callee_id_recv_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    Upon MTID tracing, the received callee ID is represented in the trace.

-   **mtrace_alltx_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    MTIDs of all transactions can be traced to link with the logging system like log4j.

-   **mtrace_basetime** <span class='type'>Miliseconds</span>

    Default `100`

    If the value of `mtrace_alltx_enabled` is `true`, it may leave too many logs. In this case, it needs to reduce the amount of trace logging.

-   **stat_mtrace_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    It collects correlation statistics between callers and callees. When applied to a caller, the caller details are sent. When applied to a callee, the caller-callee call statistics are sent to the collection server in URL units.
