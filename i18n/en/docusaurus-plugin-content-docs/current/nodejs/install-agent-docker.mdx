It guides you how to create a DockerFile in the Docker environment to install and run the Node.js agent. For the example file used in the following guide, see [the following link](https://github.com/whatap/nodejs_sample_application/tree/main/simple_http).

## File structure

The Node.js agent's sample file has the structure as follows.

-   _html_: Sample application folder.

-   _Dockerfile_: Configuration file to build the Docker image.

-   _http.js_: Sample application file.

-   _package.json_: Document for the sample application information and dependency management.

-   _whatap.conf_: Option configuration file for monitoring.

-   _paramkey.txt_: Parameter encryption key.

## Installing the agent

Add the Node.js agent in the _package.json_ file or execute the npm installation command.

```json title='package.json'
"dependencies": {
    "whatap": "^0.4.72"
}
```

```bash
npm install --save whatap
```

## Container image building

Write the Docker file to build the image.

```docker title='Dockerfile'
FROM node:latest

WORKDIR /app
ADD . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["node","http.js"]
```

## Build

Execute the build command.

```bash
$ docker build -t sampleapp/nodejs:0503 .
```

## Execution

Start the container by setting the collection server IP and access key in the environment variables. The application runs along with the Node.js agent.

```bash
export WHATAP_LICENSE={access Key}
export WHATAP_SERVER_HOST={collection server IP}

$ docker run --rm -p 3500:3500 \
    -e whatap_server_host=$WHATAP_SERVER_HOST \
    -e license=$WHATAP_LICENSE \
    sampleapp/nodejs:0503
```
