The following provides the options related to the Node.js agent DB and SQL.

-   **profile_connection_open_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
    Default `true`<br/>
    It records DB connection open data in the trace details.

-   **profile_error_httpc_time_max** <span class='type'>Int</span><br/>
    Default `30000`<br/>
    If the SQL execution time exceeds the set value, it is treated as TOO SLOW error. If it is set to `0`, it is not treated as an error.

-   **trace_sql_normalize_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><br/>
    Default `true`<br/>
    It enables the function to normalize any SQL statements by extracting the literal part from each SQL statement.

-   **hook_connection_open_patterns** <span class='type'>String</span><br/>
       It registers the method to call upon DB connection open. It is common to register getConnection of any connection pool that has not been set.

    ```ini title='예시'
    hook_connection_open_patterns=mypool.ConPool.getConnection
    ```
