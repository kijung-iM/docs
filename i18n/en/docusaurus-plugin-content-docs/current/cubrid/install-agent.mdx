## Downloading the agent

{@include: ../common-items/_db-install-agent-steps.mdx}

1.  Enter the unzipped folder and then check the _whatap.conf_ file. In _whatap.conf_, enter the project access key, WhaTap server data, and DB connection data.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
license=project access key
whatap.server.host=13.124.11.223/13.209.172.35 // WhaTap Server info

db = {$CUBRID_HOME/databases/databases.txt 의 db-name}
db_ip = {DB server IP address}
db_port = {$CUBRID_HOME/conf/cubrid_broker.conf 의 BROKER_PORT (default : 33000)}
cms_port = {$CUBRID_HOME/conf/cm.conf 의 cm_port (default : 8001)}
```

1.  Download the JDBC driver to the following directory. _/unzipped folder/jdbc_

  Download the JDBC driver for the OS and version of your database server. https://www.cubrid.com/downloads

## Creating the monitoring account

Both a DB account and a CUBRID Manager account are required for CUBRID monitoring. In general, the default dba account (`dba`) of the database and the CUBRID Manager account (`admin`) are used. You can also create a separate account.

## Creating the DB user file{#create-db-user}

Generate an encrypted UID for database connection. All user files must be run for both the user DB (`dba`) and CUBRID Manager (`admin`). Enter your username and password and run the shell script (or batch file). 

-   _The uid.sh_ shell script file (or _uid.bat_ batch file) can be found in the path where the WhaTap database agent has been installed.

-   `dba` and `DB_PASSWORD` are the username and password used for sign up.

    ```bash title='uid.sh | uid.bat'
    ./uid.sh dba DB_PASSWORD
    ./cmsuid.sh admin ADMIN_PASSWORD

    # Or

    ./uid.bat "dba" "DB_PASSWORD"
    ./cmsuid.bat "admin" "ADMIN_PASSWORD"
    ```

:::note

-   After setting it once, it collects data from the database server to be monitored through the encrypted UID.
-   To create a DB user file, enter the project access key in the _whatap.conf_ file. [Checking the project access key](#check-accesskey)
-   In the Azure database environment, enter `DB_USER` in the form of DB_USER@DB_name.
-   If special characters are included in `dba` or `DB_PASSWORD`, enter the escape character (\\) together before any special characters.

    ```bash title='예시'
    ./uid.sh whatap whatap\!pwd
    ```
