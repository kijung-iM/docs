For **CUBRID** DB monitoring, it is recommended to install XCUB, an additional agent. XCUB has to be installed on the database server and provides `sql_text` and delta calculation data of metrics. The installation and start-up method is the same as that of XOS agent.

## Configuring the whatap.conf file

-   **xcub** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `0`

    Set whether or not to use the XCUB agent. If the value is `0` the XOS agent is not used for collection. Enter the value as `1` or IP address of the XCUB agent. If the IP address is specified, data is collected from only the XCUB agent.

## Configuring the xcub.conf file

After creating the _xcub.conf_ file on the database server, you can enter the agent server information and set additional options.

-   **db** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set them in the `dbname@dbserverIP` format.

-   **dba_pwd** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Once a password has been set, the _xcub.pwd_ file is created at initial execution. After that, delete the `dba_pwd` entry in the _xcub.conf_ file.  

-   **dbx_ip** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Enter the IP address of the server in which the DBX agent has been installed.  

-   **dbx_port** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `3002`

    Set the port to communicate with the DBX agent. DBX agent can be communicated via UDP. If you have set a firewall on that port, disable it for UDP communication.

    :::note

    If you have installed the XOS agent, you do not have to set it because it is used together with the XOS port.

    :::  

-   **sql_limit** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `1024`

    The **byte size limit** of `sql_text`. Increase the value to check long queries.

## XCUB agent execution

Run the following batch file on the database server.

```bash title='start.sh'
$ ./start.sh

# or

$ ./startd.sh #In case of running in the background
```
