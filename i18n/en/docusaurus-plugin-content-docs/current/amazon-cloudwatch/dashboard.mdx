-   Namespaces are collected under the WhaTap metrics **category**. The notation format changes the Amazon CloudWatch namespace to **lowercase** and then changes "/" to "**\_**."
    > e.g. AWS/EC2 â†’ **_aws_ec2_**
-   Metrics are collected as the WhaTap **metrics**. The notation format is "CloudWatchMetric.Stat."
    > e.g. **_CPUUtilization.Average_**
