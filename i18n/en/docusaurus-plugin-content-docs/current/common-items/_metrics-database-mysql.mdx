| `max_connections`                   | **Too ManyConnection Error** may occur if the maximum number of concurrent client connections exceeds or the connection count is insufficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Info           |
| `Bytes_received`                    | If `bytes` and `Bytes_received` of the DB server are high, it indicates that this server is a write-oriented server (e.g. insert).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | MySQL Resource |
| `Bytes_sent`                        | If `bytes` and `Bytes_sent` from the DB server are high, it indicates that this server is a read-oriented (select) server. If you apply it together with `Questions` and `Uptime`, the average bytes per query and the processing bytes per hour can be counted.                                                                                                                                                                                              | MySQL Resource |
| `Created_tmp_disk_tables`           | Number of temporary tables on disk created by the server while executing commands. Because disk usage can degrade the performance, if this value increases, consider adjusting values for `tmp_table_size` or `max_heap_table_size`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | MySQL Resource |
| `Created_tmp_files`                 | Number of temporary files created by mysqld                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | MySQL Resource |
| `Created_tmp_tables`                | Number of internal temporary tables created by the server while executing commands. Temporary tables can be used in a few cases, typically when using UNION ALL in a query or when using ORDER BY, GROUP BY, or DISTINCT. It is recommended that the number of temporary tables on disk (`Created_tmp_disk_tables`) is not high (less than 10%) relative to the total number of internal temporary tables (`Created_tmp_disk_tables` + `Created_tmp_tables`). | MySQL Resource |
| `Innodb_buffer_pool_bytes_dirty`    | Number of changed data bytes in the buffer pool (number of dirty data)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | MySQL Resource |
| `Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_data`     | Number of pages in use in the total buffer pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | MySQL Resource |

| `Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_flushed`  | Number of InnoDB buffer pool pages flushed. Excessive flushing can put a strain on the disk while writing dirty data, it must be monitored along with the disk performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | MySQL Resource |
