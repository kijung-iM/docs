## Data filtering

In the Flex board, you can handle hundreds of types of data. Organize your Flex board by using the data filtering feature to narrow down what you want to monitor.

![Flex Board - Filter](/img/flexboard-filter.png)

1.  Select ![Leader line 1](/img/number-01.png) ![Filter icon](/img/ico-filter.svg) **_Filter_** on the screen. 

2.  On the left of the screen, the ![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) **_Filter_** window appears.

    -   If the **_Agent_** option has been selected, you can select filtering targets based on the agent type or application list. To select all as the filtering target, select **_Select All_**. If necessary, you can select the targets by using the **_search_** function.

    -   If the **_Metrics_** option has been selected, you can select filtering targets based on the project and agent type in **_Category_**. In the **_category_** option, you can add more by selecting **_+ And_**. If **_Includes_** or **_Exclude_** has been selected, filtering targets are automatically selected with any string.

3.  If filtering targets have been selected, select **_Apply_**. 

To save the filter settings for later use, select **_Save Filter_**. Enter the filter name and then select **_Save_**. ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) **_Saved filters_** appears at the bottom of the **_Filter_** window.

Filtering conditions are divided into the agent type and metrics type.

| Type                | Agent                                                                                                          | Metrics                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Option              | WhaTap project monitoring targets <br/>(applications, servers, DB,<br/> containers, and Kubernetes POD & node) | All metrics tags including the agent               |
| Application range   | All widgets                                                                                                    | All widgets using the metrics data                 |
| Filtering condition | Checkbox                                                                                                       | **_Equal_**, **_Includes_**, **_Exclude_** methods |

:::note

-   The agent type provides only basic monitoring targets as options.

-   The metrics type provides optional tags for all metrics data being collected in the project. Metrics types are useful when filtering is applied after collecting data in a non-agent manner, such as cloud monitoring.

-   For more information about the metrics, see [the following](metrics-intro).
