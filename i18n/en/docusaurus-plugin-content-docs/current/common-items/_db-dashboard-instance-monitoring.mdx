## Instance Monitoring

-   Multiple instances are grouped and monitored simultaneously on a screen. You can monitor the overall system status by selecting desired key metrics.

-   The real-time monitoring checks the performance metrics at an interval of 5 seconds. You can check the **_active sessions_**, **_lock information_**, and **_process information_**. 

For more information, see [the following](instance-monitoring).
