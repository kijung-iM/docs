Home > Select Project > **_STAT/REPORT_** > **_REPORT_**

Select a project in the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, and then select **_STAT/REPORT_** > **_REPORT_** under **_Project Menu_**. 

Report is a document that reports the service usage status and failure records for individual projects. The persons in charge of service monitoring share the status report with the people of related departments.

The monitoring data analysis is important because it serves as a metric for determining the direction of improvement. However, it is cumbersome to aggregate and document data from multiple dashboards.  

WhaTap's **_Report_** menu supports **automated report creation**. Through the **_Report_** menu, you can create weekly reports, share reports at the set times, and manage various templates.

## Difference between the report and integrated report

**_Report_** menu generates a report for a single project. Accordingly, this menu can be accessed through **_STAT/REPORT_** after selecting a project.

**_Integrated Report_** menu is used to create a report for multiple projects. It can be accessed from the main menus without selecting a project. For more information about the **_Integrated Report_**, see [the following](integrated-report).
