Generate an encrypted UID for database connection. Enter the username and password and then run the shell script (or batch file). 

The _uid.sh_ shell script file (or _uid.bat_ batch file) can be found in the path where the WhaTap database agent has been installed. Set `DB_USER` to `default` if there is only a password without user.

-   After setting it once, it collects data from the database server to be monitored through the encrypted UID.
-   To create a DB user file, enter the project access key in the _whatap.conf_ file. [Checking the project access key](#check-accesskey)
-   In the Azure database environment, enter `DB_USER` in the form of DB_USER@DB_name.
-   If special characters are included in `DB_USER` or `DB_PASSWORD`, enter the escape character (\\) together before any special characters.

    ```bash title='Example'
    ./uid.sh whatap whatap\!pwd
    ```
