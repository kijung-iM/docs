## Firewall configuration checking

If the TCP outbound policy for the WhaTap data collection server has not been set, monitoring data cannot be transferred. **Deselect** the **firewall blocking**.

Use the `telnet` command to check "Connected to `IP`."

```sh
$ telnet 52.193.60.176 6600
Trying 52.193.60.176...
Connected to 52.193.60.176.
Escape character is '^]'.
```

:::note

For the connection server details, select a desired project in [WhaTap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io/), and then check in **_Management_** > **_Agent Installation_**.
