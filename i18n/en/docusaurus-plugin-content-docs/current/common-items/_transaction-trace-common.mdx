-   **trace_normalize_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    It enables the function to parse and normalize transaction URLs.

    :::note

    If the value is changed to `false`, it disables the path parameter parsing. In this case, it is recommended to temporarily use the setting only for debugging purposes because the statistical data is less meaningful.

    :::

-   **trace_auto_normalize_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    It enables automatic parsing of pattern values by extracting them from annotations when normalizing transaction URLs.

-   **trace_normalize_urls** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set transaction URL patterns to normalize. It deletes the path parameter after parsing the call URL patterns.

    :::note

    For example, if declared as **/a/{v}/b**, **a/123/b** is replaced by **a/{v}/b**. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter. A complement is required after arranging substitution patterns.

    :::

-   **web_static_content_extensions** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `js, htm, html, gif, png, jpg, css, swf, ico`

    Set the extension to determine the static content. Transactions with the set extensions are excluded from the transaction tracing and counting.

-   **trace_transaction_name_header_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

    The value extracted from the set HTTP header key is added at the end of the transaction name.
