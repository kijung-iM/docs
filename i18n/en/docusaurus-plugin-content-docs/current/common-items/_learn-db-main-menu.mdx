After installing the WhaTap agent, log in [WhaTap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io). The WhaTap monitoring service provides information for smooth service provision, stable operation, and monitoring and identification of anomalies.

The DB performance management monitors the database performance in real time, diagnoses and analyzes problems, tunes problematic SQLs, and monitors whether problems have been resolved.

The WhaTap database monitoring service is designed to manage a series of operations in cycles. It is configured to help maintain consistent levels of availability and performance by monitoring, diagnosing, and analyzing the database behaviors. When a problem occurs in the database, this service sends an alarm to the staff to recognize the situation and helps you identify the root cause by analyzing the database situation more precisely through the collected data.
