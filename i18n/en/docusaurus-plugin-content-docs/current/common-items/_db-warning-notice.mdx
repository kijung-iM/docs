2.  Select **_+ Add Alert settings_**. The **_metrics_** item is created at the bottom of the screen.

3.  Select a desired metric in **_Metrics_**.

4.  Enter numeric values for **_Fatal_** and **_Warning_**.

5.  Enter a desired number in **_Number of detections_**.

6.  Select the toggle button on the utmost right to enable the alert.

## Copying the alert

You can copy any alert events created on the selected instance to another instance.

1.  Select ![Copy icon](/img/ico-copy.svg) **_Copy alert policy_**. 

2.  Select the target instance to copy. Select **_Select All_** to copy to all instances.

3.  Select **_Copy_**.

## Disabling the repeated alerts

This can prevent excessive alerts from happening. No alerts are sent for the selected period after the first alert is generated. In addition, they are not recorded in **_Event History_**.

In **_Disabled Database Alert_**, select a desired time and then select the toggle button on the right to turn on or off the function.
