Home > Select Project > {@include: _search-path.mdx}

Select a project in the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, and then select {@include: _search-path.mdx} under Project Menu. 

In **_Log Search_**, you can search a large number of integrated logs under various conditions and specify the desired logs. Multiple search conditions can be specified with parsed keys and values, so only the log data that matches the desired conditions are extracted. 

The searched log data is imported to the dynamic page line by line. If the scroll reaches the bottom, the next data is automatically retrieved and displayed. {@include: ../common-items/_log-ui-main-term.mdx}

<!-- Need to change the image when fixing the display of the number of logs viewed 0410 -->

## Request Data

-   If the scroll reaches the bottom, the next data is retrieved. You can view 30,000 logs at a time.
-   ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) You can see the total number of logs viewed. 
-   ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) Log data can be queried in chronological order or reverse order in the log table. Based on the **_Timestamp_** column, select **_Recent order_** or **_Past order_** search method.

<!-- * ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) 로그 테이블의 ***Timestamp*** 컬럼을 선택하면 로그 데이터를 시간 역순으로 조회할 수 있습니다. -->

## Checking the log content

{@include: ../common-items/_log-ui-log-content.mdx}

-   ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) For each row (log) of the **_table_**, the ![Icon](/img/ic-caret-right.svg)**_More_** button exists. If you select the button, you can check the entire content of the log like ![number-s](/img/number-04.png).
-   If you select a tag in the log, a drop-down menu appears that allows you to perform **_Copy_**, **_Search_**, and **_Exclusion Search_**.

## Filtering

#### Apply Filter

In **_Time Selector_** on the left of ![number-s](/img/number-01.png), you can specify the time range. On the right: {@include: ../common-items/_log-filter-apply.mdx} 

#### Modifying the filter

{@include: ../common-items/_log-filter-modify.mdx}

#### Filter Expression

{@include: ../common-items/_log-filter-expression.mdx}

#### Search Key

The tags on the left ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) area are the search keys parsed for each category. You can enter filters by selecting tags. The <span class='logwr'>orange</span> tag is the category, and the <span class='lowfg'>blue</span> tag is the search key.

<InDoc product='log'>

For example, <span class='logwr'>AppLog</span> and <span class='logwr'>AppStdOut</span> in ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) are categories. The tags below such as <span class='lowfg'>oid</span> are search keys parsed. The search keys can be set by registering the parsing logic in **_Log Parser Setting_** under **_Log_** > **_Log Setting_**.
