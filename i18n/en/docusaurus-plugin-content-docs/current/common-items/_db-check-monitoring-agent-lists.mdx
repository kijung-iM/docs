## Checking the monitoring

To check that the log has been normally uploaded from the server and the console has been registered normally, go to the initial screen of [Whatap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io). Select the project to check and then select **_Management_** > **_Agent List_** on the left. From **_Agent List_**, you can check the name of the database server. To set the names of database servers separately, see [the following](agent-dbx-settings#naming).
