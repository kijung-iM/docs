Home > **_Integrated Report_**

Without selecting a project in the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, under the **_main menus_**, select **_Integrated Report_**. **_Integrated Report_** can easily create reports for multiple projects. 

You can proceed with creating a report after selecting a report type and a desired report, and then you can check its progress in the report generation list. If an error occurs in a project during creation, you can check the error details. You can view a created report right away or share it with others by downloading and printing.

The functions of the **_Integrated Report_** are as follows.

-   **Supporting multiple projects**\
      In **_Integrated Report_**, you can easily select and create multiple projects at a time. Under the previous **_Report_** menu, the reports must be created for each project. <!-- It is cumbersome if you have many projects. --> 

-   **Create Report by Kind**\
       In **_Create Report_**, you can select a project by the business and save it as a template. This function is useful in the micro service architecture (MSA) environment where projects are divided into business units.

-   **대용량 데이터 최적화**\
      **_통합 보고서_** 메뉴는 보고서 생성 시간이 획기적으로 줄어들었습니다. <!-- 기존 ***보고서*** 메뉴는 하나의 프로젝트에 많은 서비스가 존재하면 보고서를 생성하는데 시간이 오래 걸렸습니다. --> 그리고 일부 프로젝트 보고서 작성 과정에서 오류가 발생하더라도 보고서 결과를 조회할 수 있습니다.

-   **Simultaneous operation during report generation**\
    In **_Integrated Report_**, you can create a report while performing other tasks. In the previous **_report_** menu, you have to wait until the generation task is finished.
    In **_Integrated Report_**, you can go to another page while creating a report. You can also see its progress and view the created report from the report result list. 

-   **Sharing the report work**\
      Any user with project permission can view the created reports. You can check whether the related report has already been created, so you can avoid creating duplicates.

## Difference between the report and integrated report

**_Report_** menu generates a report for a single project. Accordingly, this menu can be accessed through **_STAT/REPORT_** after selecting a project.

**_Integrated Report_** menu is used to create a report for multiple projects. It can be accessed from the main menus without selecting a project. For more information about the **_report_**, see [the following](report-intro).

## How to create reports

1.  **Selecting the report type**  

    ![](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/integration_report_02.png)  

    If you select a desired report type in **_Report Type_**, the **_Create Report_** button is activated. The **_icon_** before the report name indicates the project platform supported by the report form.  

    -   ![Platform Application icon](/img/platform-application.svg) indicates the **_application_** project platform.
    -   ![Platform Kubernetes icon](/img/platform-kubernetes.svg) indicates the **_Kubernetes_** project platform.
    -   ![Platform Server icon](/img/platform-server.svg) indicates the **_server_** project platform.

2.  **Detailed settings**  

    ![](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/master_report_2.png)

    After selecting a report type, click **_Create Report_**. The detailed settings are configured as follows:

    -   **Report Title**\
          If there are multiple reports of the same type, the report names make it easier to distinguish the report results.

    -   **Time**\
          Select a period for the data to be used in the report. The period differs depending on the report type (daily, weekly, monthly).  

    -   **Project Selection**\
          Select a project for report creation. Selection is possible on the group and project basis.  

    -   **Saving and importing report forms**\
          You can save the specified report settings as a template and import it from the type list upon later creation. This function is useful for those who frequently use projects on a task basis.

3.  **Create Report**\
    After configuration, click **_Create Report_** to create a report.

## Checking the job list

![](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/integration_report_03.png)

You can see the reports that were created and are being created in **_Report Generation List_**. 

In the **_All_** list, as well as the reports created by you, the reports created by other people with the same permission can be seen. In the **_My Report_** list, you can see your own reports after being filtered.

A report created with no error has the <span class='woer'>![Check icon](/img/ic-check-bl.svg) check</span> icon. In case of a report with any error, the <span class='wer'>![Warning icon](/img/ic-warning-org.svg) warning</span> icon is displayed together. If you click the <span class='wer'>![Warning icon](/img/ic-warning-org.svg) warning</span> icon, you can see in which project the error occurred.

## Viewing and sharing reports

The reports are provided in three different ways:

-   **Viewing on the screen**\
      If you select a report created in the job list, the report can be seen on the screen.

-   **Download**\
       If you click **_Download_**, the files same as reports in the quick view are downloaded in HTML format. Reports can be shared with the people with no management permission for monitoring.

-   **Printing and saving PDF**\
      If you click **_Print_**, you can print it with the printer connected to your computer or save it in PDF format.
