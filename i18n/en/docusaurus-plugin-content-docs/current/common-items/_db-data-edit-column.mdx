## Changing the table columns

You can display or hide the column entries in the table, and change their order.

1.  Select ![Column icon](/img/ico-column.svg) on the upper right of the table. 

2.  When the **_Column Setting_** window appears, hide, add, or change the order of items to be displayed in the table columns.

    -   Select a column, and then ![Left arrow icon](/img/left-arrow.svg), ![Right arrow icon](/img/right-arrow.svg), ![Add icon](/img/ico-add.svg) or ![Minus icon](/img/ico-minus.svg). Go to **_Visible_** or **_Invisible_**. 
    -   You can move the position by dragging the column while it is selected.

3.  After all settings are finished, select **_Save_**.
