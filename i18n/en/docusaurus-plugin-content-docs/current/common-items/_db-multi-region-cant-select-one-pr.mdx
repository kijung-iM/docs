### Multiple regions impossible to be selected as a single project

-   In the [WhaTap monitoring service](https://services.whatap.io) website, when creating a project, you cannot select multiple regions. When using multiple regions, create separate projects.

-   If servers exist in multiple regions as in the cloud environment, the collection servers must be located in each region to avoid constraints on the performance data collection such as network latency.

-   WhaTap builds collection servers for each region to meet customer requirements.
