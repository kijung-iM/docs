Transaction means the logical unit of work (LUW) on the server side for processing a user browser request. The process for an individual web service (URL) request is a transaction. A transaction in a web application is the process from receiving an HTTP request for a web service (URL) to returning a response.

The performance of the application can be summarized as the performance of these transactions. Transaction performance includes information such as transaction start-to-end time, response time, resource usage, or attributes of the transaction caller.

Basically, the transaction performance can be analyzed through the response distribution and statistics.
