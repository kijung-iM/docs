**_In Instance Monitoring_**, you can monitor the key metrics of the database server, information details on active sessions, lock tree, PQ tree, and process information in real time. You can also see the alerts that could be problematic warnings.

## Using the metrics chart area

You can see the information of the database server collected in real time with a chart. On the upper right of each metrics chart, select ![Configuration icon](/img/ico-setting.svg). The **_Count_** window appears to select a chart.

## Using the active session area

Through **_Active Sessions_** at the bottom of the screen, you can see the real-time active sessions and query details. If you select the **_query_** item, you can check the full text and **_plan_** data of the query (**_query_**).

## Using the event area

If an event occurs while monitoring the instances, its details are displayed in the event area on the right. If you select the event details, **_Analysis_** > **_Counts Trend_** appears. You can check the history of **_count trend_** and **_active sessions_**.
