Home > Select Project > **_Analysis_** > **_CUBE_**

Select a project on the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, and then select **_Analysis_** > **_Cube_** under the **_Project menu_**. It provides information for connections, hitmap, transactions, TOP transactions, TPS, response times, and resource usage for each country.

## What is Cube?

We call the performance statistics generated every 5 minutes as **Cube**. Cube analysis uses each 5-minute performance data stored in cubes.

## ![](/img/number-01.png) Cube selection panel

Select a cube based on the specific time in the cube selection panel in the left ![number1](/img/number-01.png) area. Because the cubes are stored every 5 minutes, select a specific time. 

-   **Panel interest metric**

    -   **_TPS_**

    -   **_Response Time_**

    -   **_Tx error count_**

    -   **_Active TX count_**

    -   **_Concurrent User_**

-   **Cube color**

    The cubes are displayed in different colors depending on the number of the selected metrics.

    -   <span class='highfg'>Dark blue</span>: <span class='highfg'>high figure</span>

    -   <span class='lowfg'>Light blue</span>: <span class='lowfg'>low figure</span>

## ![](/img/number-02.png) Application selection

You can select data for a specific application through the application selection option in the top ![number 2](/img/number-02.png) area. If you select ![down-arrow](/img/down-arrow.svg) on the right, you can see all the applications that can be selected as follows. 

![Cube selection application](/img/cube-select-app.png)

-   **_Select All_**: All applications are viewed. By default, **_Select All_** and **_Active Applications_** are selected. 

-   **_Active Application_**: Among the applications, the active applications are specified for inquiry. 

-   **_View Only Selected_**: Among the applications, only the specified applications are queried. 

-   **_Search_**: If there are many applications, you can search for them through the input field.

-   <font color='5B7DEC'>Number</font>/<font color='979797'>Number</font>: Displays the <font color='5B7DEC'>number of applications specified</font>/<font color='979797 '>number of all applications</font>.

## ![](/img/number-03.png) Cube data

!In the area of [number3](/img/number-03.png), the cube data can be checked through the charts for **_Hitmap_**, **_Country_**, **_TPS_**, **_Response Time_**, **_CPU_**, **_Concurrent User_**, **_Top TX_**, and **_Heap Memory_**.

-   **_HITMAP_**

    It displays the distribution of transactions over the cube time. Detailed trace analysis is possible. 

    If you select ![right-arrow](/img/right-arrow.svg), you can view the **_Top Stack_** and **_Unique Stack_** during the cube time.

    :::note

    The application that can use the stack analysis function is **Java** and **Python**. 

    :::

-   **_Country/Region_**

    By mapping countries based on the client IP, it displays from which country the transactions are coming. The colors on the map display the relative amount of transactions.

-   **_TPS_**

    Transaction Per Second (**_TPS_**) means the number of transactions processed per second.

-   **_Instance Response Time_**

    Average response time for transactions

-   **_CPU_**

    After sorting the project applications (agents) by the IP, it displays CPUs of the busy server with a bar chart.

-   **_Concurrent User_**

    It displays the number of real-time browser users. 

-   **_Top TX_**

    It displays 5 transactions of high invocation. Transaction statistics provide more detailed data.

-   **_Heap Memory_**

    Among the applications (instances), the instances are displayed in order of heap memory usage.

:::note

-   If you select the ![Individual icon](/img/ic-line.svg) icon on the upper right of the chart, merged line charts are provided.
-   If you select the ![Individual icon](/img/ic-multiline-chart.svg) icon on the upper right of the chart, individual line charts are provided.
-   If you select the ![Bar chart icon](/img/ic-dashboard-bar-chart.svg) icon on the upper right of the chart, the bar-type chart appears.
