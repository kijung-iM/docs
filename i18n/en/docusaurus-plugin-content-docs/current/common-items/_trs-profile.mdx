#### ![number2](/img/number-02.png) Transaction trace details

In ![number2](/img/number-02.png), the transaction execution records can be checked. The **_diagram_** chart displays the summay of the information details. The **_Multi TX Chart_** displays the associated data for each transaction. If you select **_Table View_** tab in the list, you can see the **_section time_**, **_elapsed time_**, **_step content_**, and such for each step and slowed sections can be also viewed. The transation trace details in the **_Table View_** tab are as follows.

-   **_Step_**: Step occurrence sequence

-   **_Section Time_**: Start or end time of each step

-   **_Gap_**: Gap time between the previous step and the current step

-   **_Step Time_**: Total time from the start to the end of each method

-   **_Step Contents_**: Detailed execution history of the step

Among them, **_step contents_** are classified as follows.

-   **HTTP-HEADERS**: Displays the collected HTTP's header data.

-   **HTTP-PARAMETERS**: Displays the collected HTTP parameters.

-   **DB Connection**: Displays the DB connection URL and time.

-   **SQL**: Displays SQL statements and response time errors for JDBC SQL.

-   **HTTP Call**: Displays the external HTTP service URL and response time, and errors.

-   **Message**: Displays the records for all atypical sections about the message step. It can be used to open files, output HTTP headers, output parameters, or specify arbitrary locations.

-   **SOCKET**: Represents that the socket is open. Response times are not traced.

-   **METHOD**: Displays the method name and response time for which tracing is set on the agent.

-   **Active Stack**: This indicates that active stacks have been collected. If you select **_Active Stack_**, the **_Active Stack_** window appears along with the information details.

If **_Tree View_** is selected, you can see the analysis in the form of tree view as follows. To correlate the active stack with the executed previous method, you can see the step number and find the next number in the **_Tree View_** tab. If you set a lot of method traces, the status analysis may not work well in **_Table View_**. On the contrary, with few method trace settings, **_Table View_** is better for analysis. 

![Tree View](/img/tx-trace-tree.png)

The **_Methods_** tab provides the analysis on the redundantly executed methods from the trace step information. The **_SQLs_** tab provides the analysis on the redundantly executed SQLs from the trace step information. The **_HTTP Calls_** tab provides the HTTP call count, time sum, average time, etc.The **_Multi TX Table_** tab provides multi-transaction details.

:::note

**Active Stack**

WhaTap stores multiple user requests as snapshots at default intervals of 10 seconds. The stack information stored in the snapshot is included in the transaction, and the stack information at this time is called **_active stack_**.

### Viewing the transaction parameters

1.  Add agent settings to view the SQL variables and HTTP queries.

    ```bash title='whatap.conf' {1,3}
    profile_sql_param_enabled=true 
    // SQL parameter query option: If the option is applied, SQL parameters are collected after being encrypted.
    profile_http_parameter_enabled=true 
    // HTTP parameter lookup option: If the option is applied, HTTP query parameters are collected after being encrypted.
    ```

2.  Apply the settings and then select the SQL statement within the trace step to query parameters.

    ![profile-sql](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/Screenshot_2020-12-15_W_JAVA_DEMO_5490_-_Application_Monitoring18.png)  

3.  The key required to view parameters is a 6-character string in _$WHATAP_HOME/paramkey.txt_ under the server path where the agent has been installed. You can change it to another string.

    ```bash title='paramkey.txt'
    whatap@vmwas01:/apps/whatap$ cat paramkey.txt
    A1B2C3
    ```

    :::note

    The key in _paramkey.txt_ is required to view the SQL variables and HTTP queries, and stop the threads.
