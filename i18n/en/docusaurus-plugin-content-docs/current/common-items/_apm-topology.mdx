## What is Topology?

Through the real-time data collected from the monitored servers, you can easily understand the correlation between application servers.

Learn more about the topology from the following video clip:

:::note

A typical topology definition does not include the nodes that have no link data. From the monitoring point of view, the topology also requires the data of isolated nodes.

## Basic elements of the topology

The data on the topology screen is divided into nodes, links, and additional information for each.

-   ![Leader line 1](/img/number-01.png) **Node** 

    It represents the project, application group, application, database, external host to which HTTP calls, and external module (application caller).

    :::note

    If any call information exists from the **node**, the error weight is represented outside the **node**.

    :::

-   ![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) **Link**

    It represents call data between applications or application groups, database call data, external host call data, and call data from external modules.

    -   **_Average Res. Time_**: Value of the sum of response times of transactions or calls between nodes for 5 seconds divided by the total number

    -   **_Count_**: Total number of transactions or calls (including errors) between nodes for 5 seconds

    -   **_Error_**: Total number of errors in transactions or calls between nodes for 5 seconds

    -   **_Active TX_**: Number of transactions or calls in progress between nodes

    -   **_Fetch Time_**: Total sum of record acquisition times in DB calls for 5 seconds

    -   **_Fetch Count_**: Total sum of records acquired in DB calls for 5 seconds
