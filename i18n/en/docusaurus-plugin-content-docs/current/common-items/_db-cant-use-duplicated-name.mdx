### Duplicate agent names (ONAME) impossible to be used

WhaTap DBX monitoring uses the agent's IP address and port to identify the agent. If the database server to be monitored in the user environment uses the same IP and port, the WhaTap server cannot identify the server instance.

-   If the server instance is not dynamically expanded, you can bypass it by manually setting a name for database identification by seeing [the following](agent-dbx-settings#naming).

-   If the databases to be monitored use internal addresses or duplicate IPs due to network virtualization, use separate database naming patterns by seeing [the following](agent-dbx-settings#naming).
