## What is the metrics event?

Metrics events are used to set more specific and complex events than basic events (application events, server events, and such). You can set events based on the metrics data being collected in real time from your projects. Depending on the usage, you can set any event by selecting one of two methods.

-   Metrics Event
-   Composite metrics event

:::note
For more information about the metrics, see [the following](metrics-intro).
:::

## Metrics Event

Select **_Metrics_** on the screen in **_Alert_** > **_Event Setting_**. Select ***+ Add alert policy*** on the upper right of the screen. The **_Metrics Events_** window appears.

![Metrics Event](/img/set-events-metrics.png)

### Entry of basic information

-   **_Event name_**: Enter the name of the event to add.

-   **_Activate Events_**: Select whether or not to activate events.

-   **_Templates_**: Events can be easily set after selecting a template. If the template is not to be used, select **_Not used_**.

-   **_Category_**: The unit to identify the metrics data. It is a mandatory value for setting the metrics events.

    ![Metrics Event - Category](/img/set-event-select-category.png)

    -   The **_category_** selection options display ![Leader line 1](/img/number-01.png) **_name_** and ![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) data collection interval, and ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) **_key_**. When setting up an event, use the key value of the category.
    -   **_Category_** retrieves metrics data being collected from projects within the last 3 hours and displays them in a list. If the collection interval is not displayed in the **_category_** selection options, you can select **_Enter it yourself_** option to enter a category key.

-   **_Level_**

    -   It displays the alert level when an event occurs. The levels are <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>, <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and <span style={{color:'#757575'}}>Info</span>. When setting the <span class='vslow'>Critical</span> and <span class='slow'>Warning</span> levels, the **_ANotify when event status is resolved._** selection option is enabled.

    -   **_Notify when event status is resolved._**: You can set whether or not to send notifications when the occurred event's status is resolved. This function can be enabled or disabled by selecting the toggle button.

-   **_Message_**

    -   Enter an alert message to be displayed when an event occurs. You can apply variables to the message by entering `${tag or field key}`. The key to enter into the variable must be a value contained in the selected metric data, **_Category_**.
    -   If the ![Start icon](/img/ico-timing.svg) button is clicked, you can see the history of previously entered messages.
    -   **_Test alert_** triggers alerts based on the **_event name_**, **_category_**, **_level_**, and **_message_** to check messages.

-   **_Event Rule_**<br/>
    ![Event Rule](/img/set-event-condition.png)

    By entering the ![Leader line 1](/img/number-01.png) field, ![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) operator selection, and ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) threshold value, set the event rule.

-   **_Filtering event targets_**<br/>
    ![Filtering event targets](/img/set-event-filtering.png)

    It filters the targets by entering the ![Leader line 1](/img/number-01.png) tag, ![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) operator selection, and ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) filtering value. If no input, alerts are sent to all agents.

<!--

***이벤트 발생 조건***과 ***이벤트 대상 필터링***에서 ***선택 입력*** 모드를 선택한 상태에서 마침표(.)가 2개 이상인 필드 또는 태그 이름을 선택했다면 ***직접 입력*** 모드를 선택한 다음 `${필드 또는 태그 이름}`과 같은 형식으로 묶어서 입력해야 합니다.

예를 들어 `webcheck.ping.status_code` 필드 이름과 연산자는 `!=`, 값은 `200`을 입력할 경우, ***직접 입력*** 모드를 선택한 다음 `${webcheck.ping.status_code} != 200`으로 직접 입력하세요.

:::

-->

:::note

-   For available basic syntaxes and operators in **_Event Rule_** and **_Filtering event targets_**, see [the following](#condition-guide).

-   For the **_event rule_** and **_filtering event targets_** options, you can select **_Selector_** or **_Direct Input_** mode.

-   After event settings have been saved, the option values are managed in **_Direct Input_** mode. Afterwards, if the mode is switched to **_Selector_**, the option values can be initialized.

:::

### **_Notification Setting_**

![Notification Setting](/img/set-event-receive.png)

-   **_Number of event_**: For the selected period, if the events set in **_Event Rule_** occur as many as the input, an alert is sent.

    :::note

    -   If the selected time is set to **_Not used_**, an alert is sent only when the events occur consecutively as many as the input.
    -   If the option, **_Notify when event status is resolved_** is activated, it is recommended to select **_Not used_** as the selected time.
    -   In the **_Category_** option, the collection cycle for the selected item is 5 seconds.
    :::

-   **_Event pause_**: This option can prevent excessive alerts from happening. No alerts are sent for the selected period after the first alert notification is generated. In addition, they are not recorded in **_Event History_**.

-   **_Related category_**: You can set the related categories up to 5 and see them when checking notifications.

-   **_Event Receiving Tag_**: If this tag is selected, notifications can be sent to project members and 3rd-party plug-ins with the corresponding tags. If the event receiving tag is not selected, alerts are sent to all project members.

    :::note
    In **_Alert_** > **_Notification Setting_**, you can set the tags in project members and 3rd-party plug-ins.
    :::

### **_Testing event rules_**

![Alert Test](/img/set-event-test.png)

You can check how many alerts have occurred by enabling the event conditions you set for the selected time period. If you select Run, you can see the number of notifications, and the selected fields and thresholds are displayed on the chart when the event conditions are met.

## Composite metrics event

To use the **_composite metrics events_**, you have to understand the following concepts:

-   [What is the metrics?](metrics-intro)
-   [MXQL](../mxql/mxql-overview)

The **_composite metrics event_** can generate events by using more complex rules along with the metrics data and send alerts. Composite metrics can be used effectively in the following situations:

-   You have to make comprehensive decisions on data received from multiple agents.
-   You have to compare the past data with the current ones to make judgment.

Metrics events make judgment whenever metrics are received from the agents. On the other hand, the composite metrics event stores the metrics collected from each agent into the database. Then they are reviewed to judge the event. Because of this characteristic, the data from multiple agents can be used collectively or the past data can be used. However, there is a barrier to entry that requires to use **_MXQL_**, the WhaTap's unique data query language. Therefore, event templates are provided so that users can effectively set events only if they understand the basic **_MXQL_**. Basic MXQL users can apply events by just modifying the query for event target filtering and conditions.

1.  In **_Alert_** > **_Event Setting_**, select **_Metrics_** on the screen. 

2.  In the **_Composite Metrics_** section, select **_+ Add alert policy_** on the right. 

3.  If the **_Composite Metrics_** window appears, select **_Creating as a Chart_**.

The Event Setting window appears. 

![Composite Metrics Event Setting](/img/set-event-cmetric.png)

:::note
To set a composite metrics event, you have to have the **_event setting_** role.
:::

### **_Query event data_**

The **_composite metrics event_** creates event conditions based on the metrics data query language, **MXQL**. The **_Creating as a Chart_** function provides a combo box function for automatic completion of **MXQL**. This template is used to query the event data, construct a chart, and then directly enter the event generation conditions. Set the event by selecting **_Widget_** or **_Text_**.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='widget' label='위젯'>

Through the option to configure the time series charts, you can autocomplete **MXQL** for using when setting events.

![Event data inquiry](/img/set-event-data-view.png)

-   **_Filter_**: Select an event condition target. Enter values for ![Leader line 1](/img/number-01.png) formula, ![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) tag, and ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) filtering values to create filtering conditions.<br/>![Filter](/img/set-event-cmetric-filter.png)

-   **_Group by_**: Select the grouped metrics data. You can select multiple items.

-   **_Time Unit_**: Set the time criterion for dividing the grouped data. You can set it by selecting **_sec_**, **_min_**, and **_hour_**.

-   **_Field_**: Select a field to use as an event generation condition. You can select multiple items.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='text' label='텍스트'>

The editing window appears where you can modify **MXQL** in plain text.

![Metrics Event - Text](/img/set-event-metrics-text.png)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### **_Alert_**

Enter basic data for alert settings.

-   **_Activate Events_**: You can select to enable or disable the events by clicking the toggle button.

-   **_Level_**: Select any level of <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>, <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and <span style={{color: '#757575'}}>Info</span>. <br/>**_Notify when event status is resolved_**: You can select whether or not to send additional alerts when the occurred event's status is resolved. This function can be enabled or disabled by selecting the toggle button.

-   **_Title_**: Enter the title of the alert.

-   **_Message_**: Enter an alert message to be displayed when an event occurs. You can apply variables to the message by entering `${tag or field key}`. The key to enter into the variable must be a value contained in the selected composite metrics data **_category_**.

### **_Event rule condition_**

Enter the conditions to send alerts.

-   **_Time Range_**: Set the time range to view the **_MXQL_** real-time data for event conditions. You can use only the fields included for viewing the event data.<br/>
    Composite metrics events retrieve metrics in DB for later use. Therefore, first specify the time range to query data. If you select 5 minutes for the data lookup time, the event generation conditions are checked by searching for the data collected for the last 5 minutes. You can set it short when you set any event for recent data, or long when you want to approach statistically for a wide period. For an actual use case, see [the following](#template).

-   **_Condition_**: Enter the fields, calculation rules, and thresholds reflected in MXQL.

### **_Additional_**

Set additional options that are related to receiving alerts.

-   **_Interval_**: Check the notification conditions at the selected time interval.

-   **_Silent_**: This option can prevent excessive alerts from happening. No alerts are sent for the selected period after the first alert notification is generated. In addition, they are not recorded in **_Event History_**.

-   **_Event Receiving Tag_**: If this tag is selected, notifications can be sent to project members and 3rd-party plug-ins with the corresponding tags. If the event receiving tag is not selected, alerts are sent to all project members.

    :::note
    In **_Alert_** > **_Notification Setting_**, you can set the tags in project members and 3rd-party plug-ins.
    :::

### **_Testing event rules_**

![Test Event Rules](/img/set-event-cmetric-test.png)

You can check how many alerts have occurred by enabling the event conditions you set for the selected time period. If you select Run, you can see the number of notifications, and the selected fields and thresholds are displayed on the chart when the event conditions are met.

Most of what is included in Event Setting can be specified using **MXQL**. It provides the function to simulate whether **MXQL** has been properly written. The simulation function queries the past 24-hour data to make judgment, and then informs you how many metrics were queried and how many of them are successful.

## Modifying and deleting metrics events

1.  Go to **_Alert_** > **_Event Setting_** and then select the **_Metrics_** tab. 

2.  In the event list, select ![Edit icon](/img/ico-edit.svg) at the utmost right of the item to modify or delete.

3.  If the metrics or composite metrics event setting window appears, modify each option and then select **_Save_**.

  To delete the selected event, select ![Delete icon](/img/ico-trash.svg) **_Delete_** on the upper right of the event setting window.

## Guide to select generation conditions and targets{#condition-guide}

For the event generation conditions and selection of event targets on metrics alerts, use the same syntaxes. For event generation conditions, use the tag key as a variable. For selection of event targets, use the field key as a variable.

### Basic syntax rules

-   If you just enter a string, it is recognized as a variable. If you enclose it in single quotation marks ('') or double quotation marks (""), it is recognized as text.

    ```java title='oid == "oid"'
    1. oid: variable
    2. ==: function
    3. "oid": text
    ```

    ```java title='oname이 ott-1235일 경우'
    // Normal cases
    onname = 'ott-1235' or onname = "ott-1235"

    // In abnormal cases, notification does not work.
    onname = ott-1235
    ```

-   If you just enter a number, it is recognized as number, and if you enclose it in single quotation marks ('') or double quotation marks (""), it is recognized as text.

    ```java title='oid == 123'
    1. oid: variable
    2. ==: function
    3. 123: number
    ```

    ```java title='oid가 123일 경우'
    // Normal cases
    oid = 123

    // In abnormal cases, notification does not work.
    id == '123' or oid == "123"
    ```

### Available operators

|    !=          | operand1 != operand2          | It checks whether operand1 and operand2 have different values.                                                        |
| <span>></span> | operand1 > operand2           | Check whether the operand1 value is greater than the operand2 value.                                                  |
|    > =         | operand1 >= operand2          | Checks whether the operand1 value is greater than or equal to the operand2 value.                                     |

|    and         | expression1 and expression2   | Check whether expression1 and expression2 are all `true.`<br/>The operator plays the same role as **&&**.             |
|     ||         | expression1 || expression2    | Check whether expression1 and expression2 are all `true.`                                                             |
|    or          | expression1 or expression2    | Check whether expression1 and expression2 are all `true.`<br/>The operator plays the same role as **||**.             |

#### Usage of like

To easily use the `startsWith` and `endsWith` functions, the `like` operator has been added.

-   Use of the `like` operator instead of `startsWith`

    ```java
    startsWith(Key, "Value")

    // like operator
    Key like "Value*"
    ```

-   Use of the `like` operator instead of `endsWith`

    ```java
    endsWith(Key, "Value")

    // like operator
    Key like "*Value"
    ```

-   `startsWith` and `endsWith` are supported at the same time.

    ```java
    Key like "*Value*"
    ```

-   The value, \* cannot be used in the middle of a string.

    ```java
    // Supported grammar
    Key like "tag*lue"
    ```

-   If \* is omitted in the `like` operator, it works as ==.

    ```java
    // The following two sentences have exactly the same result.
    Key like "Value"

    Key == "Value"
    ```
