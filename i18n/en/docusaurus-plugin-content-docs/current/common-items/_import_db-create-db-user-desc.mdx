Generate an encrypted UID for database connection. Enter the username and password and then run the shell script (or batch file). 

The <p><em>uid.sh</em> shell scrip file (or <em>uid.bat</em> batch file) can be found in the path where the WhaTap database agent has been installed. Set <code>DB_USER</code> to <code>{props.name}</code> if there is only a password without user. </p>
