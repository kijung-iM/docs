### How to check the firewall

It is normal only when the following connection-related information appears after executing the `telnet` command. (`telnet [Server IP] [Server Port]`)

```bash title='Example'
$ telnet 52.193.60.176 6600
Trying 52.193.60.176...
Connected to 52.193.60.176.
Escape character is '^]'.
```
