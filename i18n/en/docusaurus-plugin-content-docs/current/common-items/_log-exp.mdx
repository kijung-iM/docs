## Request Data

-   If the scroll reaches the bottom, the next data is retrieved.
-   In ![number-s](/img/number-01.png), specify the **_time_** and collection unit, **_category_**, of the log data to be searched.
-   If the **_category_** is changed, the logs that correspond to the selected category are searched. You can see the logs in ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) **_bar chart_** and ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) **_table_**.
-   If you click a bar in ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) **_bar chart_**, the logs are viewed that correspond to the time range of the bar. 
-   ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) You can see the total number of logs viewed. 
-   ![number-s](/img/number-04.png) In **_Side_**, you can see the logs filtered by tags. Up to two search keys can be selected, and multiple search values can be selected.

## Checking the log content

{@include: ../common-items/_log-ui-log-content.mdx} 

-   ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) For each row (log) of the **_table_**, the [Icon](/img/ic-caret-right.svg)**_More_** button exists. If you select the button, you can check the entire content of the log like ![number-s](/img/number-05.png).

## Viewing the logs with a chart

-   You can click a desired time in ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) **_bar chart_** to see the log of the time.
-   Under ![number-s](/img/number-02.png), use **_Time Selector Option_** on the left of ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) to search more granular logs in the selected time zone.
    -   1min: interval (spacing between bars on the chart)
    -   Time Selector Option: Time zone that divides the selected time range into 6 segments
