The performance from the start to the end of the method specified as the transaction end point, is called "transaction performance." To trace non HTTP transactions, be sure to specify the **end point**.

:::note 

Finding the **end point**

1.  Set the transaction trace for all methods where transactions are supposed to be called.
2.  After restarting, trigger a transaction for monitoring.
3.  Turn on the `back stack` option to pinpoint the entry method.
