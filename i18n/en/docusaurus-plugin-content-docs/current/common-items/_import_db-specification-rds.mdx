-   **Starting monitoring only with DB connection**

    As long as database connection is successful, you can use the monitoring service right away.

-   **Realtime DB Monitoring**

    It collects DB performance metrics and running SQLs in real time, shares the data for problem analysis and performance optimization, and enables data-based decision-making. It provides a dashboard for major issues of concern, such as active sessions and lock trees, and detects alert occurrences in real time. It provides clues for SQL tuning by checking the plan data of specific SQLs.

-   **Specific point analysis**

    By using the metrics' short-term trends, long-term trends, and metric comparison functions, you can analyze problems at the past. You can check historical data such as SQL, Lock Tree, Parallel Query, and tablespace increase/decrease. The database parameter change history is traced.
