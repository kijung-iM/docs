It is a list of syntax rules that can be used upon entry of filter. **_Live Tail_** and **_Log Search_** use the same syntax rules.

| Syntax rule   | Example        | Description                           |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| include(+)    | `+ote-gateway` | Filtering only with ote-gateway       |
| exclude(-)    | `-ote-gateway` | Filtering except ote-gateway          |
| startWith(\*) | `ERROR*`       | Filtering those that start with ERROR |
| endWith(\*)   | `*ERROR`       | Filtering those that end with ERROR   |
