## Multiple Instance Monitoring

While you can monitor only one instance in **_Instance Monitoring_**, **_Multiple Instance Monitoring_** allows you to see and compare the metrics for multiple instances on a screen. You can see the status of instances through grouped values for various key instance metrics. Using the graph charts, you can easily see the trend of instance metric values and which instances have higher values. It provides information of the longest lasting active session. For more information, see [the following](multi-instance-monitoring).
