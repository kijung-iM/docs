## Multiple transaction trace

-   **mtrace_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    It sets whether or not to use the multi-transaction tracing (MTID). By tracing the MTID, you can check the calls between all the registered applications.

-   **mtrace_rate** <span class='type'>Percentage</span>

    Default `10`

    With this option, you can set the rate of MTIDs issued when the first transaction occurs.

-   **mtrace_caller_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `x-wtap-mst`

    Set the caller key name to be used for MTID tracing.

-   **mtrace_callee_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `x-wtap-tx`

    Set the callee key name to be used for MTID tracing.

-   **mtrace_send_url_length** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `80`

    The HTTP caller passes its URL to the callee. At this time, the URL length is restricted. This sets the length value.

-   **mtrace_callee_id_send_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    When tracing the MTIDs, the callee ID issued upon the HTTPC call is included in the trace.

-   **mtrace_callee_id_recv_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    Upon MTID tracing, the received callee ID is represented in the trace.

-   **mtrace_alltx_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    MTIDs of all transactions can be traced to link with the logging system like log4j.

-   **mtrace_basetime** <span class='type'>Miliseconds</span>

    Default `100`

    If the value of `mtrace_alltx_enabled` is `true`, it may leave too many logs. In this case, it needs to reduce the amount of trace logging.

-   **stat_mtrace_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    It collects correlation statistics between callers and callees. When applied to a caller, the caller details are sent. When applied to a callee, the caller-callee call statistics are sent to the collection server in URL units.
