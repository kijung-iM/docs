## Setting the events by item

You can set the following events.

-   **_Server CPU_**, **_Server Memory_**, **_Server Disk_**<br/>
    A notification is sent when the usages of each item reach the threshold set in **_Condition (%)_**.

-   **_Active Transaction_**<br/>
    If the number of active transactions continues to exceed the threshold set in **_Condition (Count)_**, the corresponding alert is sent. The default value of occurrence is 100.

-   **_Transaction Error_**<br/>
    It indicates a transaction that has not been performed normally. If the error count continues to exceed the threshold set in **_Condition (Count)_**, the corresponding alert is sent. The collection cycle is 5 seconds.

-   **_Transaction Response_**<br/>
    Check with the transaction end time. For example, if the **_count_** of transactions that are above the **_response time_** threshold (**10** seconds) exceeds **10**, and this state **continues** for **5** seconds, the corresponding alert is sent.

-   **_Hitmap Horizontal Line_**<br/>
    If in the hitmap response time distribution, the transactions whose response time is **5** seconds or more, continuously occur <sup>\*</sup> **5** times in the same response time section, the corresponding alert is sent.

    :::note

    -   If the \* X-axis (interval of 5 seconds) distribution appears as a continuous line (it is not applied if there is a break in the middle),
    -   This is a deprecated alert setting feature. Use of the **_hitmap pattern_** alert is recommended.
    :::

-   **_Hitmap Vertical Line_**<br/>
    If in the hitmap response time distribution, any vertical line <sup>\*</sup> **continues** to appear in the X-axis zone (interval of 5 seconds) for 5 seconds during the period (1 time), the corresponding alert is sent.

    :::note

    -   \* vertical line occurrence: If among 100 sections whose **_Time Min (sec)_** is between 2.5 and 80 seconds, **30 to 50** sections are marked, the <span class='slow'>alert</span> is sent. If ![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) **50** sections are marked with same rule, the <span class='vslow'>fatal alert</span> is sent.
    -   This is a deprecated alert setting feature. Use of the **_hitmap pattern_** alert is recommended.
