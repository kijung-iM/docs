## Configuring the xos.conf file

Copy the _xos_ directory to the database server, and then enter the agent server information and set additional options in the _xos.conf_ file.

-   **dbx_ip** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Enter the IP address of the server in which the DBX agent has been installed.  
-   **dbx_port** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `3002`

    Set the port to communicate with the DBX agent. DBX agent can be communicated via UDP. If you have set a firewall on that port, disable it for UDP communication.  
-   **cpu_limit** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `0`

    It collects the process data with a value greater than the set limit. If it is 1.23% (1/100% step), set it to `123`.  
-   **mem_limit** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `10240`

    It collects the process data with a value greater than the set limit. 10240 (Kbytes) indicates 10 MB.
