## Creating a dashboard

You can create your own dashboard by creating a Flex board and placing widgets on it.

1.  From the **_Flex Board_** menu, select **_+ Create dashboard_** on the upper right.

2.  If the **_Create dashboard_** window appears, enter the dashboard name in the **_Name_** field.

3.  Select the widget placement method and then click **_Create dashboard_**.
    -   **_Fixed layout Flex board_**: Widgets can be placed freely on a pixel basis.
    -   **_Responsive Flex board_**: It provides the grid responsive layout based on the browser size. If **_Responsive Flex board_** is selected, select a grid and then select **_Create dashboard_**.

4.  In the **_widget template_** selection area, select widgets to place on the dashboard. To add any metrics widget, on the right of **_Widget Template_**, select **_All Metrics_**.

    -   **_All Metrics_**: It is used to create widgets based on all metrics data being collected from your project. For more information about the metrics widget, see [the following](flexboard-metric-widget).

5.  Reposition or resize the placed widgets.

    -   Hover your mouse cursor over the placed widget. When the cursor shape changes to a cross, click and drag the widget. You reposition it.
    -   Move your mouse cursor to the lower right of the place widget. When the cursor shape changes to an arrow, click and drag the widget. You can resize it.

6.  After placing the added widgets, select **_View Mode_** and then check the layout. To modify the layout again, select **_Edit Mode_** and then reposition the widgets.

After all things are made, select the icon ![목록으로 가기 아이콘](/img/ico-exit.svg) (**_Go to List_**) on the upper right. In the **_board_** list on the **_Flex Board_** menu, you can check the created board. By selecting a created board, you can check the new Flex board.
