Home > Select Project > **_Analysis_** > **_CUBE_**

Select a project on the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, and then select **_Analysis_** > **_Cube_** under the **_Project menu_**. It provides information for connections, hitmap, transactions, TOP transactions, TPS, response times, and resource usage for each country.

## What is Cube?

We call the performance statistics generated every 5 minutes as **Cube**. Cube analysis uses each 5-minute performance data stored in cubes.

## Cube selection panel

Because the cubes are stored every 5 minutes, you have to select a specific time. Select a specific time from the basic data on the panel.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![cube-select-pannel](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/cube.png)

</div>

There are 5 metrics of interest on the cube selection panel.

-   **_TPS_**

-   **_Response Time_**

-   **_Tx error count_**

-   **_Active TX count_**

-   **_Concurrent User_**

The cubes are displayed in different colors depending on the number of the selected metrics.

-   <span class='highfg'>Dark blue</span>: <span class='highfg'>high figure</span>

-   <span class='lowfg'>Light blue</span>: <span class='lowfg'>low figure</span>

## Application selection

In a cube, you can select a specific application data.

## Cube data

-   **_Hitmap_**<br/>
      It displays the distribution of transactions over the cube time. Detailed trace analysis is possible. 
      If you select ![right-arrow](/img/right-arrow.svg), you can view the **_top stack_** and **_unique stack_** during the cube time.
    :::note
    The applications for stack analysis are **Java** and **Python**. 
    :::

-   **_Country_**<br/>
    By mapping countries based on the client IP, it displays from which country the transactions are coming. The circle size indicates the relative amount of transactions.

-   **_TPS_**<br/>
    Number of transactions processed per second

-   **_Response Time_**<br/>
    Average response time for transactions

-   **_CPU #5_**<br/>
    After sorting the project applications (agents) by the IP, it displays CPUs of the busy server with a bar chart.

-   **_Concurrent User_**<br/>
    It displays the number of real-time users.

-   **_Top TX_**<br/>
    It displays 5 transactions of high invocation. Transaction statistics provide more detailed data.

-   **_Heap Memory #5_**<br/>
    It displays the top 5 instances of the applications that used high amount of heap memory.
