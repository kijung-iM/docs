Applied filter filters to have the logs that match the entered conditions. Multiple filters can be entered. If the tags in the filters are the same, OR (`||`) is applied; otherwise, AND (`&&`) is applied. 

You can directly enter a value in the input field or click the **_Filter_** input field to specify a filter. Separate keywords with spaces when entering values. If spaces are included in keywords, enclose them in _''_ or _""_ symbols. If _\\_ is included in a keyword surrounded by symbols, enter _\\\\_. ![Search icon](/img/ic-search-on-press.svg) If you select **_Search_**, the data with filters can be viewed in the ![number-s3](/img/number-03.png) area.
