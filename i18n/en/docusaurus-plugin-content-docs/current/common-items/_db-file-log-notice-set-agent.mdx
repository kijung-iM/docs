## Guide on how to use

To access the **_File Log Alert_** menu, add the following options to the XOS agent. You can search the log history by setting or excluding keywords.

```ini title='xos.conf'
file={fullpath} # Log file path and file name
filekey={Alert occurrence keyword}
fileexcl={Alert exclusion keyword}
```

:::note

-   It requires a read role on the log file.
-   "To set multiple files, add options in the format of `file1`, `filekey1`, `fileexcl1` / `file2`, `filekey2`, and `fileexcl2`.
-   To set multiple keywords in a file, use the vertical line (|) as the delimiter in the format of `filekey=test1|test2`.
-   If you apply `filekey` and `fileexcl` together, it corresponds to the AND condition. For example, if you have added options as `filekey=error` and `fileexcl=row`, the string containing error and row in the log file are not displayed in **_File Log Alert_**.
