The database monitoring has been installed completely. Check the checklist after installation.

## Checking the agent logs

Run the _start.sh_ shell script file or the _start.bat_ batch file from the installation path of the database agent. When you run the agent, it starts collecting monitoring data from the database. Check the agent log to see whether the agent has started.

```bash title='start.sh'
$ ./start.sh

Just Tap, Always Monitoring
WhaTap DBX version 1.3.9 20181120
```

## Checking the agent processes

You can check the status of the active WhaTap DBX agent process with the following command.

```bash title='SH'
$ ps –ef | grep dbx
```

## Checking the logs

If the log appears normally when restarting the service, you can check that the agent has been installed successfully. After registering the agent, the collection-related log can be checked in the _$WHATAP_HOME/logs_ path. If the agent runs normally, check the following log files on the date.

-   whatap-DBX-`OID`-`DATE`
-   whatap-boot-`DATE`.log

## Checking the monitoring

To check that the log has been normally uploaded from the server and the console has been registered normally, go to the initial screen of [Whatap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io). Select the project to check and then select **_Management_** > **_Agent List_** on the left. From **_Agent List_**, you can check the name of the database server.

![Database Agent List](https://img.whatap.io/media/agent_oracle/install/agent_list.png)

For the database name, an ID is given in the format of {type}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{port}.

## Agent structure

Let's learn about the elements of the agent structure.

<ImgLang img='agent-architecture.png' desc='에이전트 구성도' />

-   **Collection server**

    It collects and stores the database performance data collected by agents, extracts statistical data, and efficiently provides them to users. The collection server can be set by region. Different collection server addresses are allocated to each region. The collection server address may differ depending on the selected region. When creating a project, the region is also set.

-   **Default Agent**

    Query-based performance data is collected and transmitted to the server. Monitoring is possible without installing agents directly on the database server to be monitored.

-   **Additional agent (XOS agent)**

    <ImgLang img='agent-xos-architecture.png' desc='XOS Agent Architecture' />

    The XOS agent is an optional add-on agent that can monitor the process usage of the database server. To monitor the process usage of the database server, run a separate agent on the database server to collect data. For more information about the process monitoring configuration, see [the following](agent-manage).

    :::note

    The XOS agent can be applied to only the OS environment running on the x86 architecture.

    :::

-   **Network**

    -   Default agent: The WhaTap monitoring agent uses the external communication (TCP) port 6600 to transfer the collected monitoring data to the WhaTap collection server.

    -   Additional agent: The external communication (UDP) port 3002 is used between the server where the agent has been installed and the database server. If the internal port conflicts, the port can be changed using the `dbx_port` option.
