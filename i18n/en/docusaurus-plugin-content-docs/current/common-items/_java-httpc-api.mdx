-   **profile_error_httpc_time_max** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `10000`

    If the HTTPC execution time exceeds the set value, it is treated as TOO SLOW error. If it is set to `0`, it is not treated as an error.

-   **profile_httpc_resource_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    When collecting HTTP call steps from the transaction trace, the CPU and memory usages in the step is traced.

-   **profile_position_httpc** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    It records the stack traces at the execution time of HTTPC.

-   **trace_httpc_normalize_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    It enables the function to parse and normalize HTTPC URLs for transactions.

-   **trace_httpc_normalize_urls** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set the HTTPC URL patterns to normalize. It deletes the path parameter after parsing the call URL patterns.

    :::note

    For example, if declared as **/a/{v}/b**, **a/123/b** is replaced by **a/{v}/b**. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter. A complement is required after arranging substitution patterns.

    :::

-   **hook_httpc_patterns** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set the `full package class name`.`method` for HTTP outbound calls. Register and use the full path of the method that performs HTTP calls. After registration, you need to redefine the class or restart the agent.

    ```ini title='whatap.conf'
    hook_httpc_patterns=io.home.test.baseapp.app.post.service.HookHttpcService.*
    ```

    :::note

    -   To register multiple classes, use comma (,) as the delimiter. 

    -   Only asterisk (\*) can be used as the wildcard, regular expressions cannot be used.
