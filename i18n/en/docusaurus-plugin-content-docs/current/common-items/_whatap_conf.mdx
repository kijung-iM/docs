## Configuring the whatap.conf file

Go to the unzipped `$WHATAP_HOME` path. Check whether the access key and data collection address are correctly written in _$WHATAP_HOME/whatap.conf_. If there is no value, go to the [WhaTap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io) screen, and then copy and paste **access key** in the **_Install guide_** section.

```ini title=$WHATAP_HOME/whatap.conf
license={access key}
whatap.server.host={collection server IP}
```

:::note

-   If the agent has been downloaded by clicking **_Download_**, the settings exist in whatap.conf. 

-   If directly downloaded from the server, enter the **access key** and **collection server IP**.

-   For more information about _whatap.conf_, see [the following](set-agent).
