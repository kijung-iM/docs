## Alert Repetition Setting{#escalation}

If the symptom is not resolved since the alert occurrence time, you can set the notification repetition interval from the initial alert occurrence time. For example, to repeat an alert after 0 minutes (immediately), 1 hour, and 1 day from the alert occurrence time, enter `0,1H,1D` in the **_Repeat Alert (Escalation)_** column.

:::note

-   If you omit the unit such as **M**: Minute, **H**: Hour, **D**: Day, you can set the time in minutes.

-   If **_Save_** is not selected, configuration cannot be finished.

-   Enter the value in the following format: number or number + unit (**M**, **H**, **D**). If the input is wrong, the corresponding message appears.
