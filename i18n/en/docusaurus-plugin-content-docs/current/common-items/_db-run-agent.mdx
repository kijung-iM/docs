## Running the agent

Execute a shell script (or batch file) from the path where you have installed the agent.

<Tabs groupId='os'>

<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

```bash
./start.sh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```bash
start.bat
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To use it like a daemon, execute the following command. However, it works only in the environment where **nohup** has been installed.

```bash
./startd.sh
```

You completed installing the agent for database monitoring. In [the following](after-install-agent), check the post-installation checklist.
