-   **whatap.name** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `{type}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{port}`

    Set the agent name with patterns.

-   **whatap.oname** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set the agent name with strings.

-   **whatap.okind** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set the group unit to which the agent belongs. By setting multiple agents together, the topology can be checked by the group name.

-   **whatap.onode** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set the node unit to which the agent belongs.

-   **auto_oname_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    The function to automatically obtain the agent name (`whatap.oname`) from the server is activated. Upon application, the options for `-Dwhatap.name` and `-Dwhatap.oname` are ignored. It obtains `whatap.oname` through communication with the collection server and then starts the agent's operation.  

-   **auto_oname_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `agent`

    When an agent name is automatically granted from the server, the prefix of the agent name (business name as usual) is used. The prefix + serial number (from 1) is assigned.

-   **auto_oname_reset** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `0`

    Modify it to obtain a new agent name from the server. If the agent name is automatically granted, the system environment variable, `whatap.oname` is set. Once set, the system environment variables are not changed until the Java instance is restarted. For a reset, modify the value of `auto_oname_reset`. If you change it to a value different from the current setting, it is to be applied.
