## Difference between the report and integrated report

**_Report_** menu generates a report for a single project. Accordingly, this menu can be accessed through **_STAT/REPORT_** after selecting a project.

**_Integrated Report_** menu is used to create a report for multiple projects. It can be accessed from the main menus without selecting a project.
