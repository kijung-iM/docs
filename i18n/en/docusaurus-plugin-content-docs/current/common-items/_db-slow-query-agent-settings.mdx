## Guide on how to use

To use the **_Slow Query_** menu, set parameters and roles as follows.

### Configuration of DB, parameters, and roles

```ini
slow_query_log = 1
long_query_time = 3 # e.g. Recording for SQLs taking 3 seconds or more
log_output=FILE # or TABLE
```

:::note

If you set as `log_output=TABLE`, the role and capacity management are required for `mysql.slow_log`. Execute the following command.

```bash
grant select on mysql.slow_log to whatap;
```

:::

### Configuring the whatap.conf file

```ini title='whatap.conf'
slow_query_log=ON
```

:::note

-   If you have set `log_output=FILE` in DB server, you need to install XOS. For more information, see [the following](agent-xos-settings).
-   RDS requires configuration to use CloudWatch instead of installing XOS. For more information, see [the following](agent-dbx-settings#using-aws-rds).
