## What is the metrics?

The numerical performance indicators being collected by the project are called **_Metrics_**. Metrics are categorized so you can explore data by using the category tag.

-   **Category**: A group of related metrics
-   **Tags**: Data containing unique identifiers to find the targets to collect
-   **Fields**: Metrics collected from the agent

For more information about the metrics, see [the following](metrics-intro).

## Types of metrics widgets

The widget types that can be added in **_All Metrics_** are classified into table widgets that list the category tags and fields, and trend charts for a single field.

-   **Table Widget**: It provides a table for data of the selected metrics category.
