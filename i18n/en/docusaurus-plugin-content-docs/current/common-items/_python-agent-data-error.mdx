## Errors of project agent unregistration and no monitoring data collection

Check the log file (_$WHATAP_HOME/logs/_) and then resolve each problem as follows:

-   _whatap-hook.log_
    -   CONF FILE ERROR: There is no permission to create the configuration file. Create the file.
    -   CONF READ ERROR: The configuration file exists but does not have the read role. Give the role to the file.
    -   LOG FILE ERROR: There is no create permission for the log directory. Create the directory.
    -   LOGGING ERROR: The log directory exists but does not have the write role.
-   _whatap-boot-`yyyymmdd`.log_
    -   license or whatap.server.host error: Wrong access key or collection server address

### Port conflict

Agents communicating internally use the UDP 6600 port by default. In case of internal port conflict, change the port with the `net_udp_port=xxx` option.

### Unable to set the $WHATAP_HOME environment variable

-   **Apache HTTPD**
      To run the web server with Apache, set the environment variable as follows:

    ```bash title=SH
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        #ServerName
        #DocumentRoot

            SetEnv WHATAP_HOME "application path"
        # Directory
    </VirtualHost>
    ```
-   **Manual configuration of an environment variable**
      If necessary, set an environment variable as follows:

    ```python title=Python
    ---
    import os
    os.environ.setdefault("WHATAP_HOME", [application path]")
    import whatap
    ---
    ```
