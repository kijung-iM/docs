<summary>Agent Name Setting</summary>
In the WhaTap monitoring service, the term, "object" is used for comprehensive meaning of a monitoring target, and it is sometimes used interchangeably with the agent. To distinguish the objects to be monitored, the different names must be used. WhaTap identifies the target through the object name and object ID.

:::note

-   The object (agent) names must be unique on a project basis.
-   Object ID = CRC32 (object name). If the object ID or name has been changed, the previous data is not connected.

:::

WhaTap basically uses the data collected from database servers to identify each server while collecting monitoring data. Basic information uses the database server as a unique identifier by a combination of database server type, IP address, service port, and such. If necessary, use the name set by the user or change the pattern to a unique value. The agent name must be unique.

The reason why the data extracted from the application server is used, is like the following. When a communication loss of the collection server and agent caused by the stop of the database server, network disconnection, or agent problem is restored, the continuity of the data from the reconnected agent is maintained.
