### Speed Meter

![Speed Meter](/img/speedmeter.png)

A water-drop icon running from left to right on the speedometer indicates a transaction. The status of active transactions is identified by the speed (<span class='normal'>Normal</span>, <span class='slow'>Slow</span>, <span class='vslow'>Very Slow</span>) and its number appears on the upper right. The middle area represents active transactions, and the right area represents completed transactions.

### Agent Summary

<ImgLang img='agent-dashboard-summary.png' desc='Agent Summary' />

It displays the status and number of the registered agents.

### **_Active Status_**{#active-status}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-status.png' desc='액티브 스테이터스' />

Active transactions are classified by the execution section and displayed with an equalizer. All agents in the project collect the active transaction count every 5 seconds, along with the progress status. The active status is classified into  **_METHOD_**,  **_SQL_**,  **_HTTPC_**,  **_DBC_**, and  **_SOCKET_**.

Equalizer's color means the importance. **_DBC_** and **_SOCKET_** are must be recognized as problem even it one or two appear continuously. Meanwhile, **_SQL_** and **_HTTPC_** require analysis when the number is relatively great. **_METHOD_** is in blue because it is normal. If you click ![right-arrow](/img/right-arrow.svg), **_Dashboard_** > **_Active Transaction_** appears.

-   **_METHOD_**: Status in which the method is executing.

-   **_SQL_**: SQL is running.

-   **_HTTPC_**: It is calling any external API.

-   **_DBC_**: The transaction is attempting to get a new connection from the connection pool.

-   **_SOCKET_**: TCP socket is being connected from outside.

:::note

If the **_DBC_** or **_SOCKET_** count persists above 1, suspect any problem.

:::

### **_Active Transaction_**

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-tx.png' desc='액티브 트랜잭션' />

A transaction in progress is called **_active transaction_**. It is represented with an **_Arc Equalizer_** chart. The arc is divided by the number of agents. By representing the number of requests being processed by the server every 5 seconds, you can tell how long the request has been processed. Requests detected at an interval of 5 seconds are classified by color as follows to determine whether they are dangerous or not.

-   Red (<span class='vslow'>Very Slow</span>): 8 seconds or more 

-   Orange (<span class='slow'>Slow</span>): 3 to 8 seconds

-   Blue (<span class='normal'>Normal</span>): 0 to 3 seconds

The situation where lots of blue colors are represented is not a problem. You must watch the trend to see whether some of them turn to purple or red. In case of a failure, the number of active transactions increases and the percentage of red color increases. On the other hand, a very responsive system with a high number of process transactions (TPS) might have a low number of active transactions.

-   On the upper left, the agent name with the most active transactions appears.

-   You can toggle the views by selecting the icon on the upper right. If you click ![right-arrow](/img/right-arrow.svg), **_Dashboard_** > **_Active Transaction_** appears.

    -   ![Include inactive agents icon](/img/ico-disable-agent.svg) **_Include inactive agents_**: Inactive agents are included.

    -   ![Arc Equalizer icon](/img/ico-arc-equalizer.svg) **_Arc Equalizer_**: The graph is displayed with an arc equalizer.

    -   ![Vertical Equalizer icon](/img/ico-vertical-graph.svg) **_Vertical Equalizer_**: The graph is displayed with a vertical equalizer.

-   The middle number is a sum of active transactions of the selected agent.

-   Two bars around active transactions rotate around the chart at a three-step rate based on the throughput (TPS).

:::note

For more information about transactions, see [the following](track-transactions-intro).

:::

### **_HITMAP_**

The **_hitmap_** chart represents the distribution of response times of completed transactions. The horizontal axis is the transaction end time. The vertical axis is the execution time. Transactions with longer execution times are at the top of the distribution. If you drag the area in **_HITMAP_**, you can see the transaction information details.

:::note

-   The detailed information for the transactions with no error whose execution time is less than 500 ms is collected once every 5 minutes for each URL.

-   It does not affect the statistics such as TPS and average response time.

-   Policy can be adjusted through the agent settings. See the transaction-related information in the configurations for each agent.

:::

In **_HITMAP_**, the point color represents its density.

-   Normal TR: Sky blue → Blue → Indigo

-   Error TR: Yellow → Orange → Red

<ImgLang img='hitmap.png' desc='히트맵' />

-   The number on the upper right indicates the <span class='normal'>transaction count</span>/<span class='slow'>error count</span> in the chart.

-   If **_Y-axis Auto_** is selected, the Y-axis (execution time) is automatically adjusted.

-   If **_Error_** is selected, only the error transactions appear.

-   Select ![Up arrow icon](/img/up-arrow.svg) or ![Down arrow icon](/img/down-arrow.svg) to zoom in/out the chart from 5 seconds to 80 seconds.

### **_Apdex_**

![Apdex](/img/apm-dashboard-apdex.png)

{@include: ../common-items/_java-apdex-desc.mdx}

:::note

The default value of S (Satisfied) can be changed in **_Management_** > **_Agent CONF._**. The value of the setting key is `apdex_time`. It is available only in the agent 2.0 or later.

:::

### **_TPS_**

Transaction Per Second (TPS) indicates the number of transactions processed per second and is the reference among service performance metrics. The number of transactions processed every 5 seconds is converted to the number of transactions per second and is expressed with a chart.

![TPS](/img/apm-dashboard-tps.png)

### **_Today's TPS_**

It displays the TPS for today by hour. You can check it by comparing with the TPS (gray) in the same time zone of yesterday. If you click ![right-arrow](/img/right-arrow.svg), **_STAT/REPORT_** > **_Daily Application Status_** appears.

### **_Today's Visits_**

It displays the user count for today by hour. You can check it by comparing with the user count (gray) in the same time zone of yesterday. If you click ![right-arrow](/img/right-arrow.svg), **_STAT/REPORT_** > **_Daily Application Status_** appears.

### **_Average response time_**

It monitors the times needed for the application server to return the request result. The **_average response time_** is meaningful as a tuning metric. The WhaTap's monitoring service calculates the average response time for transactions every 5 seconds.

### **_System CPU_**

It is the CPU usage of the application server. You can see the change trend in CPU usage in real time.

### **_Heap Memory_**{#heap-memory}

You can see which servers are at risk by displaying the maximum available memory and the current memory for each server. The changes in memory usage over time can be seen in real time.

The memory line chart usually ripples continuously. It increases when using memory to process the requests from the application server. It decreases when memory is cleaned up through GC (Garbage Collection). The **_heap memory_** metric is displayed with average values.

:::note

-   Java and Node.js display the total heap memory and usage.

-   PHP, Python, and .Net display the process memory usage.

:::

### **_Concurrent User_**

It displays the number of real-time browser users. Every 5 seconds, users who have generated transactions within the last 5 minutes are counted and displayed. Users are counted based on their browser's IP. In the agent settings, the IP or cookies can be used to distinguish users.

:::note

-   In general, the connected user means a connected user who has access to the current network. However, web systems are different because they use connectionless networks. It does not mean that you are connected, but rather the user who sent the recent request can be measured.

-   Real-time (concurrent access) users indicate the users who are using the system in the same time zone. There are various ways to count or measure real-time (concurrent access) users.

-   The number of users is calculated by **HyperLog** rather than simply adding up. **HyperLog** is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the number of elements in a set with very little memory.

-   For more information about the method how to analyze **_Application Dashboard_**, see [the following](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dashboard).
