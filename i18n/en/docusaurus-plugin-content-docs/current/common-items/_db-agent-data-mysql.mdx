-   **deadlock_interval** <span class='type'>Int</span><br/>Default `60`<br/>
    Set the interval to fetch the deadlock data from the MySQL (unit: second). The deadlock data is obtained only from the latest deadlock data that occurred during the set interval.

-   **my_opt** <span class='type'>Int</span><br/>Default `0`<br/>
    Depending on the role to the MySQL's data directory, `performance_schema` may not be available even though it is available. In this case, the DBX agent does not work. Set it to `1` to disable the `performance_schema`.
