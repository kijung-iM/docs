A typical log integration service consists of the collector, processor, repository, and UI module. The process of building each module is cumbersome and additional costs are incurred because it requires step-by-step configuration and structuring.

WhaTap log monitoring is easy to apply. Because the previous monitoring agent acts as a collector, the log monitoring can be started simply by turning on the agent option.

-   It directly collects the logs that are forwarded to the log library of your Java application rather than reading the output file.  

-   Because the logs are collected directly, it does not cause file I/O so the performance impact on the system is very low.

-   You can check logs from the transaction traces by obtaining the connection traceability for transaction traces and logs.
