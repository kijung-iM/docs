## ![](/img/number-03.png) Log Monitoring Data Setting{#log-data-setting}

At the top of ![number-s](/img/number-03.png), you can see the **_Log Usage_**. Furthermore, you can change the settings for **_Data Retention_** and **_Log lookup password_**.

### Data retention period{#data-retention}

This is the default data retention period to be applied commonly. If not specified, the default value is 1 day. If you do not set the data retention periods for each category, this data retention period is applied by default. If you set the data retention periods for each category and select **_Reset_**, the default data retention period is reset.

### Data retention periods for each category

You can specify the log data retention periods for each category. **Log Count** means the log lines stacked for the period. For example, **_Today Log Count_** is the number of log lines accumulated during the day, and **_Expected Log Count_** is the number of log lines of the today's log count multiplied by the days of data retention. 

You can specify the log data retention period as follows. You can free the space by deleting old data according to the specified period.

-   **Trial Project**  

    You can select 1, 2, or 3 days for the data retention period.

-   **Paid Project**  

    For the data retention period, you can select one of 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 30 days, and 40 days.

-   **Data size-based billing**   

    The price differs depending on the data retention period.

    > For example, if an average of 2 million log lines per day accumulates and the data retention period is set to 3 days, an average of 6 million log lines is kept on the collection server and subject to billing.

### Log lookup password

To enhance security, set the **_log lookup password_**. The log lookup password is optional. If you are using a log lookup password, enter the password to go to the log screen. 

:::note

**In case you forgot the password**

If you have the **Edit Log** role, you can modify it with a new password in **_Log Setting_**.

:::

## ![](/img/number-04.png) Log Parser Setting{#log-setting-parser}

You can register **parsing** logic to create a key to retrieve the collected logs. If the parsing logic is not registered, searching is possible only with the following keys.

:::note 

**In case of no parsing logic registered, keys for search**

`category`, `oid`, `oname`, `okind`, `okineName`, `@txid`, `@login`, `httphost` 

:::

### Parser registration procedure

![](/img/log-setting-parser.png)

1.  On the lower part of the ![number-s](/img/number-04.png) area, select **_+ Add_**.

2.  In the ![number-s](/img/number-04.png) area, select a parser in the **_parser selection_** window. For more information about the parser and pattern registration, see [the following](#log-pattern).

3.  In the **_category selection field_** of ![number-s](/img/ic-number-07.svg), select a category or directly input it. 

4.  You can add a filter by selecting ![Icon](/img/ico-filter.svg)**_filter_** of ![number-s](/img/ic-number-07.svg). If you enter a filter, the pattern is applied to the log data that meets the filtering condition.

5.  To check whether the pattern is normal, click **_Simulation_** of ![number-s](/img/ic-number-08.svg) and then measure the performance of simulation and pattern. For more information about the simulation and performance measurement, see [the following](#parser-simulation).

6.  If the simulation is normal, in the ![number-s](/img/ic-number-08.svg) area, click **_Save_** to save it.

:::note

-   ![number-s](/img/ic-number-07.svg) Adding a **_filter_** is optional.
-   If you select **_Reset_** in the ![number-s](/img/ic-number-08.svg) area, the written content is initialized.
-   By selecting ![number-s](/img/ic-number-09.svg) and then dragging the parser setting, you can change the sequences.

### Pattern registration types{#log-pattern}

![](/img/log-parser-pattern.png)

Four different types of parsers are provided as follows. In the parser selection window of ![number-s](/img/number-04.png), you can see the results.

1.  **Grok Parser**

2.  **JSON Format Parser**

3.  **4xx** and **5xx Status Code Parser**

4.  **Status Code Success Rate Parser** 

:::note

-   4XX, 5XX status code parsers and status code success rate parsers can be used only when the status key has been extracted through the Grok or JSON format parser.
-   When registering a parser, you cannot register the parser twice in the same category.

:::

### Registering the Grok pattern parser{#log-pattern-grok}

![Grok 패턴 파서](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/log_011_grok_syntax.png)

Its syntax is %{SYNTAX:SEMANTIC}.    

-   **SYNTAX**

    Grok definition pattern.

-   **SEMANTIC**

    It is the key allocated to the parsed data.

    :::note 

    It is recommended to use combination words in SEMANTIC so that reserved words are not used.

    :::

### Registering the JSON Format Parser Pattern{#log-pattern-json}

![Registering the JSON Format Parser Pattern](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/log_012_json_format_parser_1101.png)  

If all or part of a log is output in JSON format, you can parse the JSON output through the JSON format parser.

To detect the JSON output of the log, the **_prefix_** and **_postfix_** options are combined to specify which part of the log to be recognized by JSON for parsing. 

| Option  | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prefix  | Specify the string before the beginning of JSON string. If not specified, it is identified as a JSON string from the beginning of the log output. |
| Postfix | Specify the string after the end of JSON string. If not specified, it is identified as a JSON string up to the end of the log output.             |
| Ignore  | Specify fields in the JSON output to exclude from key extraction.                                                                                 |

-   **Registration example**

    ```bash title='Log'
    [2022-10-25 10:15:34:145]...(line feed)
    Request : {"key1":"value1","key2":"value2",...}(line feed)
    Response : {"key3":"value3","key4":"value4",...}
    ```

    As in the example, to parse both Request JSON and Response JSON for incoming logs, register the following two patterns.

    -   Pattern for request parsing  

        > String between "Request : " and "Response" {"key1":"value1","key2":"value2",...} Target

    -   Pattern for response parsing

        > String from "Response : " to the end of a log {"key3":"value3","key4":"value4",...} Target
-   **JSON custom pattern registration**

    If part of a log is output in JSON format, the JSON output can be parsed by a dedicated custom parser. Enter the pattern as follows:

    ```java
    io.whatap.logsink.parser.JsonFormatParser{}
    ```

    To detect the JSON output of the log, the **_prefix_** and **_postfix_** options are combined to specify which part of the log to be recognized by JSON for parsing.

    Specify an option in `{}` of `JsonFormatParser{}`.

    -   **Registration example**

        ```bash title='Log'
        [2022-10-25 10:15:34:145]...(line feed)
        Request : {"key1":"value1","key2":"value2",...}(line feed)
        Response : {"key3":"value3","key4":"value4",...}
        ```

        As in the example, to parse both Request JSON and Response JSON for incoming logs, register the following two patterns.

        -   Pattern for request parsing  
            > String between "Request : " and "Response" {"key1":"value1","key2":"value2",...} Target

        ```java
        io.whatap.logsink.parser.JsonFormatParser {prefix:"Request : ",postfix:"Response"}
        ```

        -   Pattern for response parsing
            > String from "Response : " to the end of a log {"key3":"value3","key4":"value4",...} Target

        ```java
        io.whatap.logsink.parser.JsonFormatParser {prefix: "Response : "}
        ```

### 4xx, 5xx Status Code Parser registration{#4xx-5xx-status-parser}

![4XX 5XX Status Code Parser](https://img.whatap.io/22/11/28/085706log_020_status_parser.png) A parser that can be used if the status has already been parsed. Additional 4xx and 5xx status codes are parsed using the parsed status. You can create 4xx and 5xx counts with the parsed data. 

You can enter or select 4xx, 5xx status codes in the pattern, and the entered status codes are excluded when parsing 4xx, 5xx status codes from the log. To use the 4xx, 5xx status code parser, the status must have been parsed first.

-   **Registration example for the status parser**

    ![Grok파서 - status 파싱 패턴 등록](https://img.whatap.io/22/11/28/111724log_status_01_parser.png)

    If the incoming log is `{"msg":"message","status":404}` and its status is parsed by the Grok parser as shown in the example, it is parsed as `status: 404`. If you confirm that the status has been normally parsed, register the 4XX, 5XX status code parser pattern.     

-   **Widget Templates**

    If all parsers have been registered, go to **_Flex Board_** and then create the log 4XX, 5XX count widget.

    ![](https://img.whatap.io/22/11/28/111724log_status_02_widget_template.png)  

    If the widget is created, you can see the following data.

    ![](https://img.whatap.io/22/11/28/111724log_status_03_widget.png)

    -   **_avg_**: Average value of the data during the query period
    -   **_max_**: Maximum value of the data during the query period
    -   **_recently_**: Final value of the data during the query period

### Registering the Status Code Success Rate Parser's pattern{#log-pattern-status}

![Status Code Success Rate Parser](https://img.whatap.io/22/11/28/090004log_021_status_success_rate_parser.png)
The status code success rate parser can be used when the status has already been parsed. For more information about status parsing, see [the following](#4xx-5xx-status-parser). 

Additional 2xx and 3xx status codes are parsed using the parsed status. HTTP request success rate data can be generated using the parsed data. You can enter or select 2xx, 3xx status codes in the pattern, and the entered status codes are excluded when parsing 2xx, 3xx status codes from the log. 

-   **Widget Templates**

    If all parsers have been registered, go to **_Flex Board_** and then create the log request success rate widget.  

    ![Flex Board - Log Request Success Rate Widget Template](https://img.whatap.io/22/11/28/120046log_success_rate_01_widget_template.png)  

    If the widget is created, you can see the following data.

    ![Flex Board - Log Request Success Rate Widget](https://img.whatap.io/22/11/28/120046log_success_rate_02_widget.png)

    The data above the chart represents statistics for the lookup period. You can select the statistical method with the latest value, maximum value, or average value. The latest value is selected by default.

### Parser Simulation{#parser-simulation}

:::note

**Simulation Support**

The current JSON format parser does not support the simulation.

![](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/log_016_performance.png)

### Successful parsing

If the key has been generated by registering a parsing logic, the value parsed with the key is added upon log inquiry. The parsed key and value are added to the blue box of the following image. 

![](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/log_017_parsed.png)

The parsed key can be checked in **_Live Tail_**, **_Log Search_**, and **_Log Trend_**.

## ![](/img/number-05.png) Fast Index Setting{#log-setting-index}

Collecting a large number of logs can significantly decrease the log search performance. The frequently used search conditions are created as **index**, you can improve the log search performance for quick search. The setting items are as follows:

| Set value        | Required  | Description                                  |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
