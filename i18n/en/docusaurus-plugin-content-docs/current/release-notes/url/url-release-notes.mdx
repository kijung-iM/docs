### Minor Change

Changed the URL Monitoring User-Agent name in Java/1.8 to Whatap URL Monitoring Agent. 

## URL Monitoring Agent 2.0.1

Release date: 2021-10-07

### Bug fixing

-   FullChain 인증서를 사용하지 않는 일부 URL에서 `sun.security.validator.ValidatorException ` 발생하는 현상을 개선했습니다.

-   Modified to enable URL checking for the SHA-256 ECDSA algorithm certificate that was not supported in the previous version.

## URL Monitoring Agent 0.0.3

Release date: 2019-04-25

### Bug fixing

Fixed the case where the following error occurred because it was impossible to monitor the URLs with the HTTPS protocol.

```java title='Java'
sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```

In case of SSL-based communication, because the mechanism to accept a certificate and enable communication is required, the client module has been improved to accept the certificate when accessing the registered URL.
