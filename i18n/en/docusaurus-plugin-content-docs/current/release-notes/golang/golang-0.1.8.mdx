## Beta - update

### Adding the concurrent user collection setting

The concurrent user metric displays the number of unique users from 5 minutes ago. The total number of users for 5 minutes appears. Unique user data is processed with the HyperLogLog algorithm.

Unique user data is initially set as IP. In addition, the user identification data can be set as the values for HTTP header and cookie. 

#### Configuration

`trace_user_header_ticket`\
#Default : ""#\
#Type : string#

Select the set HTTP header value as the unique user data.

`trace_user_cookie_keys`\
#Default : ""#\
#Type : string#

Select the set cookie value as the unique user data. With comma (,) as the delimiter, multiple names can be set. Search in the set order.

### Active Status

The active status function has been added. 

The active status graph appears on the dashboard screen. Status includes general function, SQL, DB connection, external HTTP connection, and socket connection. The counts of active requests for each status appears on the graph.

### Collecting the internal metrics

Run a separate goroutine to collect metrics at an interval of 5 seconds. 

### Collecting the runtime metrics

In **_Analysis_** > **_Metrics Chart_**, you can select the category, `go_runtime` for inquiry.

### Supporting RoundTripper by the NET/HTTP library

It supports to use RoundTripper in the HTTP transport. Use the `whatapsql.OpenContext` function instead of the `sql.Open` function from the database/sql package. It is recommended to use the functions that pass the context, such as `PrepareContext`, `QueryContext`, and `ExecContext`. 

The context to be delivered must have the whatap TraceCtx data through `trace.Start()`.

```go title='Install guide '
import (
  "github.com/whatap/go-api/instrumentation/net/http/whataphttp"
)

func main() {
  config := make(map[string]string)
  trace.Init(config)
  defer trace.Shutdown()
  
  ctx, _ := trace.Start(context.Background(), "Http call")
  defer trace.End(ctx, nil)

  callUrl := "http://aaa.com/xxx"
  client := http.DefaultClient
      
  // Use the WhaTap RoundTripper. Deliver the context that has the whatap's TraceCtx. 
  client.Transport = whataphttp.NewRoundTrip(ctx, http.DefaultTransport)
      
  resp, err := client.Get(callUrl)
  if err != nil {
      ...
  }
  defer resp.Body.Close()

  ...
}
```
