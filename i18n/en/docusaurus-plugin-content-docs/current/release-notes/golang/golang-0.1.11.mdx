## Beta - bug fixing

### Correction of the parameter collection error

For collection of internal parameters, the `ParseForm()` function call in `http.Request` has been deleted. By calling the function in advance, an error occurs later when accessing the body or parameters of the multipart/form-data type. 

At the end of transaction, it has been modified to only retrieve the contents of request.

## Beta - update

### Database/SQL transaction-related modification

Inside the database/SQL driver, for `Begin()`, `BeginTx()`, `Commit()`, `Rollback()`, and `Close()` functions, the part that was collected in the form of SQL statement is now collected as a general message. It is retrieved only in the transaction profile data. 

In **_Statistics_** > **_SQL_** Statistics, it is no longer viewed.

### Collecting errors not included in the web transaction

In case of web transactions in the past, the error data was collected only when the context includes WhaTap data (`trace.Start()` call required) and the unique transaction ID (`Txid`) was granted. 

If there is no unique transaction ID, the collected data can be retrieved from only the statistical data. 

### Collecting error.(Type) data upon error collection

Error statistics are divided into two parts: class and message. In the past, `error.Error()` messages were collected equally as classes and messages. 

As shown below, `error.(Type)` is collected in the class, and `error.Error()` is collected in the message. 

| Class                  | Message                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| \*`errors.errorString` | custom panic                                                |
| \*`errors.errorString` | mysql: driver does not support the use of Named Parameters  |
| `mssql.Error`          | mssql: Incorrect syntax near '1'.                           |
| \*`echo.HTTPError`     | code=404, message=Not Found                                 |
