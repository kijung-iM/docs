Release date: 2021-11-10

## Change (update)

### File-related functions added

In addition to the `fopen()` function being collected, the execution time and file name of `file()` and `file_get_contest()` functions are collected.

File-related collection target functions

```php
fopen()
file()
file_get_contents()
```

## Fixed (bug fixing)

### GET parameter collection error fixed

Fixed an error where GET parameters cannot be collected when the URL has been changed from the CodeIgniter framework to the rewrite module. Parameters were separated from `Query_string` of the URI and added without duplication. 

### HIT disabled warning in PHP 8.0

In PHP 8.0, when setting `opcache.jit=on`, the following warning notification error has been corrected.

```bash
PHP Warning: JIT is incompatible with third party extensions that override zend_execute_ex(). JIT disabled. in Unknown on line 0
```

:::note

PHP 8.03 or later is recommended.
