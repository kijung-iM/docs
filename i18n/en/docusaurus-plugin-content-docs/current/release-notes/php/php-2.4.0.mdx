## Change (update)

### PHP 8.1

PHP 8.1 is supported.

## Fixed (bug fixing)

### cURL header setting data initialization error

When setting the HTTP header (CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER) through the `curl_setopt` and `curl_setopt_array` functions, if duplicate settings are made, the previous data is initialized and the new data is set. 

When the multi-transaction (`whatap.mtrace_enabled=true`) setting is enabled, there is an error in which the previous user header data is initialized by setting the Whatap Header data before the `curl_exec()` function. 

The function to set the WhaTap Header has been removed before calling the `curl_exec()` function and it has been modified to set it after calling the `curl_init()` function. 

If the user header is set before the `curl_exec()` function is called, the WhatTap header set in advance is deleted. 

To do multi-transaction, add the WhatTap header directly in the PHP source code according to the following guide. 

Sample source code /usr/whatap/php/lib/Whatap/sample_mtrace.php

```php title='php'
// Whatap installation directory (/usr/whatap/php/lib/Whatap/Whatap.php)  
// Load Whatap.php. 
include_once './Whatap.php';

...

// User header information
$headers = array();
array_push($headers, "aaaa:bbbb");

// Add the Whatap header 
$whatap_mtrace = Whatap::whatap_get_mtrace();
foreach ($whatap_mtrace as $key => $value){
	//echo $key."=".$value."<br/>";
	array_push($headers, "$key:$value");
}
unset($value);

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
...
```

You can adjust the automatic setup function with the following settings: 

`whatap.mtrace_auto_inject_enabled=true`  

-   After calling the `curl_init()` function, the whatap header is set while internally calling `curl_setopt()`.
-   `false`: The automatic setting for the WhaTap header is stopped.
