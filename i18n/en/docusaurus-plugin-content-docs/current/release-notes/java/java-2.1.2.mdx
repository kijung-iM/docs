```ini title='whatap.conf'
debug_async_thread_enabled=false
```

### Saving the database call URL

Modified to save the database call URL.

### Deletion of the database call hash value

Deleted the database call hash value from an error text.

### Modification of the agent execution logo

The logo content has been modified while the Java agent is running.

```bash
The Best Observability in Java
```

### Modified the asynchronous HTTP call error notification message.

The notification message has been modified to display the status code when an asynchronous HTTP call error occurs.

### Modification of the license key option in the agent settings

Modified whatap.conf to use both license and accesskey options.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Same function
license=
accesskey=
```

### Modification of the Java agent meta option name

Modified the name of the Java agent meta tag option.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
agent_meta_tags_enabled=true
```

## New features

### Adding the exclusions for the agent environment variables

The function has been added to exclude from the search items when a specific key value is entered in the environment variable search function.

The delimiter is "," and the value is not case sensitive. It can be used in connection with the `agent_env_system_enabled` and `agent_env_jvm_enabled` settings.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
agent_env_system_enabled=false
agent_env_jvm_enabled=true

agent_env_ignore_keys=user.timezone,user.name,user.language
```

### Adding the linked service tracing function

The linked service status tracing function has been added so that the target IP or service connection status can be checked in liveTail of log monitoring.

You can enable the function by setting `logsink_rt_enabled` to `true`, which collects logs with the `#RemoteTrace` category.

-   In case of a normal response, the level is ok. In case of error, the level is error.

-   In case of a normal response, logs are recorded according to `logsink_rt_ok_interval`. The default value is 30 seconds.

-   In case of an error response, logs are recorded according to `logsink_rt_ok_interval`. The default value is 5 seconds.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
logsink_rt_enabled=false

logsink_rt_error_interval=5000
logsink_rt_ok_interval=30000
```

### Adding the external call error notification

The function has been added to receive a notification when an error occurs when calling HTTP or database or the response is slower than the specified time.

-   The function can be enabled by setting `exception_alert_enabled` to `true`.

-   Using the `exception_alert_stack_size` option, you can specify the error stack length to receive alert messages.

-   You can disable error notifications for the specified period by the `exception_alert_silent_time` option.

-   The notification messages include URL, `status_code`, `error_message`, and `error_stack`.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Default
# Whether the error notification is enabled
exception_alert_enabled=false

# Whether the transaction error notification is enabled
exception_alert_service_enabled=false

# Whether the error notification is enabled upon HTTP call
exception_alert_httpc_enabled=false

# Whether the error notification is enabled upon JDBC call
exception_alert_jdbc_enabled=false

# Length of the stack displayed in the error notification message
exception_alert_stack_size=50

# Period of disabling the error notification message = 5 minutes (30000ms)
exception_alert_silent_time=300000

# Status code to ignore in the transaction error notification
status_alert_ignore=403

# url:status_code combinations to ignore in the transaction error notification
status_alert_ignore_set=/api/test/timeout:408

# Status code ignored in the HTTP call error notification
httpc_status_alert_ignore=408,500

# url:status code combinations ignored in the HTTP call error notification
httpc_status_url_alert_ignore_set=/api/test/timeout:408
```

### Adjustment of error levels of transactions and HTTP calls

A function has been added to recognize the status of transactions or HTTP calls as normal. When the transaction or HTTP call status is set to info, the version function has been added so that errors not handled by Spring Framework's ExceptionHandler can be recognized as normal. If the condition is met, INFO appears at the ErrorLevel in the hitmap and the error statistics include it.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Default
transaction_status_mode=normal
httpc_status_mode=normal

# Ignoring errors
transaction_status_mode=info
httpc_status_mode=info

# Recognized as status code info to ignore in the transaction error notification
status_alert_ignore=403

# url:status_code combinations to ignore in the transaction error notification are recognized as info
status_alert_ignore_set=/api/test/timeout:408

# Recognized as status code infor ignorec in the HTTP call error notification
httpc_status_alert_ignore=408,500

# url:status code combinations ignored in the HTTP call error notification are recognized as info
httpc_status_url_alert_ignore_set=/api/test/timeout:408
```

### Adding the Alibaba Druid connection pool tracing function

The function to trace the Alibaba Druid connection pool has been added.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
druid_pool_enabled=false
```

### Addition of the netstat function

Added the function to collect netstat by using the OSHI library. Among network metrics, the packet, collision, drop, error, and bps are collected.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
oshi_netstat_enabled=false
debug_oshi_netstat_enabled=false
```
