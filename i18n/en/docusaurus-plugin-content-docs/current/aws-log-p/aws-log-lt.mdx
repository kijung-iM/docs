Home > Select Project > **_Dashboard_** > **_Live Tail_**

Select a project in the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, and then select **_Dashboard_** > **_Live Tail_** under Project Menu. In **_Live Tail_**, you can easily check the log data stream on the monitoring screen without accessing the server console. You can select necessary logs from numerous logs and quickly recognize the desired logs through the highlight function.

In **_Live Tail_**, complex logs can be easily accessed. You can search the logs in real time by using the functions such as **_Filter_** or **_Highlight_**, if necessary. The log data search cycle is 2 seconds. {@include: ../common-items/_log-ui-main-term.mdx}

#### Apply Filter

Applied filter filters to have the logs that match the entered conditions. Multiple filters can be entered. If the tags in the filters are the same, OR (`||`) is applied; otherwise, AND (`&&`) is applied. 

You can directly enter a value in the input field or click the **_Filter_** input field to specify a filter. Separate keywords with spaces when entering values. If spaces are included in keywords, enclose them in _''_ or _""_ symbols. If _\\_ is included in a keyword surrounded by symbols, enter _\\\\_. ![Search icon](/img/ic-search-on-press.svg) If you select **_Search_**, the data with filters can be viewed in the ![number-s3](/img/number-03.png) area.

#### Filter input syntax

It is a list of syntax rules that can be used upon entry of filter. **_Live Tail_** and **_Log Search_** use the same syntax rules.

| Syntax rule   | Example       | Description                           |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| include(+)    | \+ote-gateway | Filtering only with ote-gateway       |
| exclude(-)    | \-ote-gateway | Filtering except ote-gateway          |
| startWith(\*) | ERROR\*       | Filtering those that start with ERROR |
| endWith(\*)   | \*ERROR       | Filtering those that end with ERROR   |

## ![](/img/number-02.png) Content filter area

#### Content Filter

Only the logs containing the keyword in the content pieces are filtered. 

![](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/livetail_008_contents_filter.png)

-   Enter the filter in the input field and then click ![Icon](/img/ic-search.svg) **_Search_**. You can filter the log data on the client and then look it up in the ![number-s3](/img/number-03.png) area. 
-   Content strings including the keyword are highlighted.
-   You can filter by single or multiple keywords.

<!-- whatap is good~whatap is the best -->

#### Content filtering condition

When filtering with multiple keywords, write as follows.

| String to input     | Description                                                        | Result            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| a b c               | Separate each keyword with a space.                                | a, b, c           |
| "Whatap is good."   | To include spaces in keywords, wrap them in '' or "".              | Whatap is good.   |
| "Whatap\\ is good." | If \\ is included in the keyword surrounded by "", enter it as \\. | Whatap\\ is good. |

#### Highlight

The highlight function is provided to easily identify the desired keywords.

-   The settings are saved in **Project Rules**.  

#### Setting the table

            ![](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/livetail_017_table_column_visible.png)
