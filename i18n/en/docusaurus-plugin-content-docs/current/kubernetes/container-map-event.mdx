The events provided in WhaTap Kubernetes Monitoring are as follows:

-   Kubernetes event (**_kubernetes_**)
-   WhaTap event (**_WhaTap_**)

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes events are provided by Kubernetes itself. In the Kubernetes environment, you can use the `kubectl get events` command to get the event data of the Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
$ kubectl get events -A

However, the event data is not stored continuously. The events that occurred after a specified time are no longer available. 

WhaTap Kubernetes collects and stores all Kubernetes events that occurred in the user cluster environment. Event data such as pod, ReplicaSet, deployment, and namespace is provided according to the target to check.

![Kubernetes event](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_kubernetes_container_map_event_k8s.png)

The bars on the left of each event indicate the event types. Gray means <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span>, and orange means <span class='slow'>Warning</span>. These event types are identical to the event types provided by Kubernetes.

Available Kubernetes events according to the selected target are as follows:

| Selected target | Provided event                                                                  | Provision-related event                                                                              |

| ReplicaSet      | ① `kind` is ReplicaSet.② <br/>`name` is identical to the user's ReplicaSet name | `name` starts with the user ReplicaSet name.                                                         |
| Pod (container) | ① `kind` is Pod② <br/>`name` is identical to the user pod name                  | The pod starts with the name of the deployment to which the pod belongs or with the ReplicaSet name. |

Kubenetes events stored in WhaTap consists of `message`, `namespace`, `kind`, `name`, and `reason`.

## WhaTap

In the container map, you can check a list of events based on the WhaTap alert settings.
