Agent installation steps to monitor applications such as Java, Python, and Node.js in containers.

The installation of micro-application agent is the same as the procedure of Application Monitoring Agent Installation. The difference is that the containerization task has been added. See the following link.

-   [Java agent installation](https://docs.whatap.io/java/install-agent)

-   [Python agent installation](https://docs.whatap.io/python/install-agent)

-   [Node.js agent installation](https://docs.whatap.io/nodejs/install-agent)

To proceed with the application agent installation, select **_Application Agent Installation_** at the lower right of the screen in **_Management_** > **_Agent Installation_**.

In the **_Check Access Key_** section of the installation guide page, select **_Getting the access key_**. If an access key has been already issued, the key appears.

:::caution

-   Use of the service is restricted if the **access key** is invalid. You can renew or extend it through ![Channel inquiry icon](/img/ico-help.svg) **_Channel inquiry_** on the upper right of the screen.
-   The **access key** cannot be duplicated for other projects, and it is different from the **cluster project** authentication key.
