It is a dashboard that allows you to see the status of applications running inside the container in real time. For normal data output of each widget, the node agent must have been installed in the Kubernetes environment, and the WhaTap agent must also have been installed in the application inside the container. 

:::note

WhaTap agent installation is supported only for applications developed with Java, Node.js, and Python.
