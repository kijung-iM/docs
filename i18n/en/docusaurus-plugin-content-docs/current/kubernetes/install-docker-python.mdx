This process applies the WhaTap monitoring agent to the Python application running on the Docker container and packages the container image.

## Downloading the agent

Install the whatap-python package when building your Python application docker image.

```docker title='python ver 3.7'
RUN pip3 install --upgrade whatap-python
```

## Agent CONFIG.

1.  If the Python application starts, change the application startup script to allow the agent to be injected. 

    Set the log and configuration file paths as the `WHATAP_HOME` environment variables.

    ```python
    export WHATAP_HOME={로그 및 설정 파일 경로}
    ```

2.  Execute the following command to create and configure the _whatap.conf_ file in the path set as `WHATAP_HOME`.

    ```bash
    whatap-setting-config \
    --host {Collection Server IP} \
    --license {Access Key} \
    --app_name {User-defined Application Name} \
    --app_process_name {Process Name: e.g. uwsgi, gunicorn}
    ```

:::caution

If any role issues, assign roles to the `$WHATAP_HOME` variable as follows:

```bash
echo `sudo chmod -R 777 $WHATAP_HOME`
```

## Kubernetes's environment variables and volumes

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='basic' label='Default' default>

Set the following environment variables: `NODE_IP`, `NODE_NAME`, and `POD_NAME` to collect nodes and pods in transactions. Mount volatile volumes for WhaTap configuration files and log files.

```ini
env:
  - name: NODE_IP
    valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
  - name: NODE_NAME
    valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
  - name: POD_NAME
    valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='eksfragate' label='EKS Fargate'>

1.  Add `shareProcessNamespace` and `serviceAccount` to observe user pod resources to fields in _.spec_ of Deployment or ReplicaSet.

    ```ini
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    ...
    spec:
    ...
        spec:
          shareProcessNamespace: true
          serviceAccount: whatap
    ...
    ```

2.  Set the following environment variables: `NODE_IP`, `NODE_NAME`, and `POD_NAME` to collect nodes and pods in transactions. Mount volatile volumes for WhaTap configuration files and log files.

    ```ini
    env:
      - name: NODE_IP
        valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
      - name: NODE_NAME
        valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
      - name: POD_NAME
        valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
    ```

## Starting the monitoring

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='command' label='Command' default>

Add the command, `whatap-start-agent` before the application startup command.

```python
# whatap-start-agent python manage.py runserver
whatap-start-agent {application startup command}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='uwsgi' label='uWSGI'>

Add the command, `whatap-start-agent` before the application startup command.

```python
# whatap-start-agent uwsgi --ini myapp.ini
whatap-start-agent {application startup command}
```

#### In case the application is started by registering uWSGI in the service

-   If the user has been changed, you have to add the `WHATAP_HOME` environment variable.
-   If the virtual environment has been used, add the agent startup command in the absolute path.

Modify the service execution file (_/etc/init/uwsgi.conf_) and then start the application with the agent startup command. Depending on the user environment, the path of the service executable file may differ.

```python title='/etc/init.d/uwsgi'
description "uWSGI application server handling myapp"
start on runlevel {2345}
stop on runlevel {!2345}
exec whatap-start-agent {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}

# Or

exec env WHATAP_HOME={PATH} {absolute path}/whatap-start-agent {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}
```

```ini title='/etc/init/uwsgi.conf'
...
NAME="uwsgi"
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
DAEMON=/usr/local/bin/uwsgi
PID=$RUN/$NAME.pid
INI_PATH=/etc/$NAME/$NAME.ini

########## WHATAP_AGENT_CONF ##########
WHATAP_HOME={PATH}
WHATAP_AGENT={절대 경로}/whatap-start-agent

...
do_start(){
  env WHATAP_HOME=$WHATAP_HOME $WHATAP_AGENT {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='gunicorn' label='Gunicorn'>

Add the command, `whatap-start-agent` before the application startup command.

```python
# whatap-start-agent gunicorn myapp.wsgi
whatap-start-agent {application startup command}
```

#### In case the application is started by registering Gunicorn in the service

-   If the user has been changed, you have to add the `WHATAP_HOME` environment variable.
-   If the virtual environment has been used, add the agent startup command in the absolute path.

Modify the service execution file (_/etc/init/gunicorn.conf_) and then start the application with the agent startup command. Depending on the user environment, the path of the service executable file may differ.

```python title='/etc/init.d/gunicorn'
description "Gunicorn application server handling myapp"
start on runlevel {2345}
stop on runlevel {!2345}
exec whatap-start-agent {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}

# Or

exec env WHATAP_HOME={PATH} {absolute path}/whatap-start-agent {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}
```

```ini title='/etc/init/gunicorn.conf'
...
NAME="gunicorn"
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
DAEMON=/usr/local/bin/gunicorn
PID=$RUN/$NAME.pid
INI_PATH=/etc/$NAME/$NAME.ini

########## WHATAP_AGENT_CONF ##########
WHATAP_HOME={PATH}
WHATAP_AGENT={absolute path}/whatap-start-agent

...
do_start(){
  env WHATAP_HOME=$WHATAP_HOME $WHATAP_AGENT {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='supervisor' label='Supervisor'>

-   If the user has been changed, you have to add the `WHATAP_HOME` environment variable.
-   If the virtual environment has been used, add the agent startup command in the absolute path.

Modify the service execution file (_/etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisor.conf_) and then start the application with the agent startup command. Depending on the user environment, the path of the service executable file may differ.

```ini title='supervisor.conf'
[program:app-uwsgi]
environment = WHATAP_HOME={PATH}
command = {absolute path}/whatap-start-agent /usr/local/bin/uwsgi --ini /home/blog/backend/config/uwsgi.ini
[program:nginx-app]
command = /usr/sbin/nginx
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='code' label='Code'>

You can apply the agent by adding the code that calls the API directly at the top line.

```python
import whatap
whatap.agent()
```
