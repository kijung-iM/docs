This process applies the WhaTap monitoring agent to the Python application running on the Docker container and packages the container image.

## Downloading the agent

Install the whatap-python package when building your Python application docker image.

```docker title='python 3.7 버전'
RUN pip3 install --upgrade whatap-python
```

## Agent CONFIG.

1.  If the Python application starts, change the application startup script to allow the agent to be injected. 

  Set the configuration file and log output directory to the environment variable `WHATAP_HOME`.

````
```python
export WHATAP_HOME=/whatap_conf
```
````

1.  Create the configuration file.

    ```bash
    whatap-setting-config\
    --host {collection server IP}\
    --license XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    --app_name {application name}\
    --app_process_name {application process name}
    ```

:::caution

If any role issues, assign roles to the `$WHATAP_HOME` variable as follows:

```bash
echo `sudo chmod -R 777 $WHATAP_HOME`
```

## Kubernetes's environment variables and volumes

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='basic' label='기본' default>

Set the following environment variables: `NODE_IP`, `NODE_NAME`, and `POD_NAME` to collect nodes and pods in transactions. Mount volatile volumes for WhaTap configuration files and log files.

```ini
env:
  - name: NODE_IP
    valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
  - name: NODE_NAME
    valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
  - name: POD_NAME
    valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='eksfragate' label='EKS Fargate'>

1.  Add `shareProcessNamespace` and `serviceAccount` to observe user pod resources to fields in _.spec_ of Deployment or ReplicaSet.

    ```ini
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    ...
    spec:
    ...
        spec:
          shareProcessNamespace: true
          serviceAccount: whatap
    ...
    ```

2.  Set the following environment variables: `NODE_IP`, `NODE_NAME`, and `POD_NAME` to collect nodes and pods in transactions. Mount volatile volumes for WhaTap configuration files and log files.

    ```ini
    env:
      - name: NODE_IP
        valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
      - name: NODE_NAME
        valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
      - name: POD_NAME
        valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
    ```

## Starting the monitoring

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='command' label='Command' default>

Add the command, `whatap-start-agent` before the application startup command.

```python
# whatap-start-agent python manage.py runserver
whatap-start-agent {application startup command}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='uwsgi' label='uWSGI'>

Add the command, `whatap-start-agent` before the application startup command.

```python
# whatap-start-agent uwsgi --ini myapp.ini
whatap-start-agent {application startup command}
```

#### In case the application is started by registering uWSGI in the service

-   If the user has been changed, you have to add the `WHATAP_HOME` environment variable.
-   If the virtual environment has been used, add the agent startup command in the absolute path.

Modify the service execution file (_/etc/init/uwsgi.conf_) and then start the application with the agent startup command. Depending on the user environment, the path of the service executable file may differ.

```python title='/etc/init.d/uwsgi 예시'
description "uWSGI application server handling myapp"
start on runlevel {2345}
stop on runlevel {!2345}
exec whatap-start-agent {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}

# Or

exec env WHATAP_HOME={PATH} {absolute path}/whatap-start-agent {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}
```

```ini title='/etc/init/uwsgi.conf 예시'
...
NAME="uwsgi"
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
DAEMON=/usr/local/bin/uwsgi
PID=$RUN/$NAME.pid
INI_PATH=/etc/$NAME/$NAME.ini

########## WHATAP_AGENT_CONF ##########
WHATAP_HOME={PATH}
WHATAP_AGENT={절대 경로}/whatap-start-agent

...
do_start(){
  env WHATAP_HOME=$WHATAP_HOME $WHATAP_AGENT {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='gunicorn' label='Gunicorn'>

Add the command, `whatap-start-agent` before the application startup command.

```python
# whatap-start-agent gunicorn myapp.wsgi
whatap-start-agent {application startup command}
```

#### In case the application is started by registering Gunicorn in the service

-   If the user has been changed, you have to add the `WHATAP_HOME` environment variable.
-   If the virtual environment has been used, add the agent startup command in the absolute path.

Modify the service execution file (_/etc/init/gunicorn.conf_) and then start the application with the agent startup command. Depending on the user environment, the path of the service executable file may differ.

```python title='/etc/init.d/gunicorn 예시'
description "Gunicorn application server handling myapp"
start on runlevel {2345}
stop on runlevel {!2345}
exec whatap-start-agent {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}

# Or

exec env WHATAP_HOME={PATH} {absolute path}/whatap-start-agent {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}
```

```ini title='/etc/init/gunicorn.conf 예시'
...
NAME="gunicorn"
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
DAEMON=/usr/local/bin/gunicorn
PID=$RUN/$NAME.pid
INI_PATH=/etc/$NAME/$NAME.ini

########## WHATAP_AGENT_CONF ##########
WHATAP_HOME={PATH}
WHATAP_AGENT={absolute path}/whatap-start-agent

...
do_start(){
  env WHATAP_HOME=$WHATAP_HOME $WHATAP_AGENT {YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND}
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='supervisor' label='Supervisor'>

-   If the user has been changed, you have to add the `WHATAP_HOME` environment variable.
-   If the virtual environment has been used, add the agent startup command in the absolute path.

Modify the service execution file (_/etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisor.conf_) and then start the application with the agent startup command. Depending on the user environment, the path of the service executable file may differ.

```ini title='supervisor.conf 예시'
[program:app-uwsgi]
environment = WHATAP_HOME={PATH}
command = {absolute path}/whatap-start-agent /usr/local/bin/uwsgi --ini /home/blog/backend/config/uwsgi.ini
[program:nginx-app]
command = /usr/sbin/nginx
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='code' label='Code'>

You can apply the agent by adding the code that calls the API directly at the top line.

```python
import whatap
whatap.agent()
```
