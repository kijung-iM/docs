Home > Select Project > **_Resource_** > **_Namespace Status_**

You can check the status of the WhaTap Kubernetes cluster project and sub namespace projects. This menu cannot be accessed by the namespace project. 

The **_Namespace Status_** menu is similar to the project list screen, but has the following differences:

-   **_Project list_**

    After creating a namespace project, you can move the project to another group, but the namespace is difficult to see at a glance.

-   **_Namespace Status_**

    -   Namespaces that do not belong to the same group as the cluster project can also be checked.
    -   You can see all related projects at a glance.

In case of the cluster project, the <span class='normal'>blue</span> tag appears that indicates the Kubernetes platform. In the namespace project, the **_Namspace_** tag appears. The title on the upper left of the widget is the project name, and the namespace name appears next to the **_Namspace_** tag at the bottom.

:::note

WhaTap Kubernetes Service's **cluster project** is a new name for the **master project**.
