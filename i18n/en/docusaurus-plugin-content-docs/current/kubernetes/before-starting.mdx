## Cluster and project configuration

WhaTap Kubernetes monitoring service manages one or more WhaTap projects for a user's Kubernetes cluster environment.

The user's Kubernetes cluster is basically represented as a **cluster project** on the WhaTap service. When you first create a project for your Kubernetes product, the project is a **cluster project**. If there are multiple namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster and there are numerous containers and pods, you can divide the WhaTap project by creating and separating namespace projects for each namespace.

### ![](/img/number-01.png) Cluster Project

-   It is a project for monitoring all resources in a Kubernetes cluster.

-   Through the **cluster project**, proceed with installation of the master agent and node agents.

-   In the project list, **cluster projects** appear with the `CP` tag next to the project name and the `Kubernetes` tag at the very bottom.

-   For more information about the creation of **cluster project**, see [the following](install#create-project).

### ![](/img/number-02.png) Namespace Project

-   It is a project, a Kubernetes cluster's child namespace unit.

-   This project monitors the resources in namespace units and monitors application containers.

-   In the project list, **namespace projects** display the `Namespace` tag at the bottom.

-   For more information about the **namespace project** management, see [the following](namespace).
