## Select Category (Container view, Pod view)

When you enter the **_Container map_** menu for the first time, you can see that all individual containers or pods in your cluster project have been expanded. Because multiple containers can run within a pod, you must have views for each container and pod.

In **_Container Map_** for WhaTap Kubernetes, both **Per-container view**, **Per-pod view** are supported, so condition-based monitoring is possible such as container-level monitoring and pod-level monitoring.

-   **Per-container view**

-   **Per-pod view**

**Per-container view** and **Per-pod view** can be switched depending on the user settings of the **_Container Map_** menu.

:::note

If you are using an older version of the Kubernetes agent, you cannot see the per-pod view. Upgrade the agent.

```bash title='Master'
kubectl set image deployment/whatap-master-agent whatap-master-agent=whatap/kube_mon:{agent version} -n whatap-monitoring
```

```bash title='Node'
kubectl set image daemonset/whatap-node-agent whatap-node-agent=whatap/kube_mon:{agent version} -n whatap-monitoring
```
