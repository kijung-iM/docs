On the **_Install guide_** screen, select your service environment and then install the master and node agents according to the procedure. 

<Tabs groupId='k8stype'>

<TabItem value='kubernetes' label='KUBERNETES' default>

## Pre-environment checking and setting

Depending on the Kubernetes environment, pre-environment configuration may be required. If your Istio, GKE, or OpenShift environment is not applicable, skip to the next step.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value='istio' label='ISTIO environment' default>

In the ISTIO environment, execute the following command to create required resources.

```bash title='SH'
kubectl create namespace whatap-monitoring
kubectl label namespace whatap-monitoring istio-injection=enabled
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: whatap-external
spec:
  hosts:
  - whatap-proxy1
  - whatap-proxy2
  addresses:
  - 13.124.11.223
  - 13.209.172.35
  ports:
  - name: proxy
    number: 6600
    protocol: tcp
    location: MESH_EXTERNAL
EOF
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='gke' label='GKE Environment'>

In case of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), create a user cluster and then execute the following command to set roles.

```bash
ACCOUNT=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.account)')
kubectl create clusterrolebinding owner-cluster-admin-binding \
  --clusterrole cluster-admin \
  --user $ACCOUNT
```

:::note

For more information about installation with the gcloud commands, see [Google Cloud Document](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='openshift' label='OpenShift Environment'>

![OpenShift](/img/kube-install-openshift.png)

On the **_Install guide_** screen, open the **_Additional settings for OpenShift environment_** section and then select **_openshift_scc_**. After downloading the file, execute the following command.

```bash
oc create -f whatap_openshift_scc.yaml
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Creating the Kubernetes agent

In this step, download the YAML file suitable for your Kubernetes version and container runtime, and then install the agent.

1.  Check the **VERSION** and **CONTAINER-RUNTIME** by executing the following command on the master node.

    ```bash
    kubectl get node -o wide
    ```

    ![](/img/k8s-check-version.svg)

2.  On the **_Agent Installation_** screen, select the YAML file that matches the **VERSION** and **CONTAINER-RUNTIME** and then select **_Download_**.

    ![](/img/k8s-download-yaml.png)

3.  Upload the downloaded YAML file to the master node.

4.  Execute the following command on the master node to create an agent. 

    ```bash
    # Modify the {whatap_kube_X.YZ.yaml} filename to match the downloaded filename.
    kubectl apply -f {whatap_kube_X.YZ.yaml}
    ```

    :::note

    **The WhaTap agent needs a small Persistent Volume (PV) to keep the project information.** In K8S of a public cloud environment, a PV can be automatically created only with a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) request, but in a private environment, execute the command after a PV that can receive WhaTap's PVC request has been created.

    :::

You can see that the agent has been successfully created using the Kubernetes API.

![](/img/k8s-install-agent-check.svg)

## Checking the Kubernetes agent installation

Execute the following commands to check the status of the master agent and node agents.

```bash
kubectl get pod -n whatap-monitoring
```

![](/img/k8s-check-running-agent-monitoring.svg)

If **STATUS** is **Running**, it indicates the installation is complete. After installing the master and node agents, start monitoring the resources in your Kubernetes environment. Go to [Whatap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io) and then check the performance data collection in **_Project list_** and **_Dashboard_** > **_Container Map_**.

#### In case the status is not Running

![](/img/k8s-not-running-agent-monitoring.svg)

Execute the following command on the master node to determine the cause of the pod creation failure. Check the **Events:** item at the bottom of the execution result.

```bash
kubectl describe pod {POD_NAME} -n whatap-monitoring
```

![](/img/k8s-check-install-fail.svg)

:::tip

When using the `kubectl` command, the `-n {namespace}` option performs the task for specific namespaces. Because the WhaTap agent is installed in the namespace named `whatap-monitoring` by default, add the `-n whatap-monitoring` option.

<TabItem value='eksfragate' label='EKS Fargate'>

## Creating the Kubernetes agent

1.  Download the installation file for Kubernetes Monitoring. Select **_whatap_kube_fargate_**.

2.  Create an agent with the downloaded YAML file.

    ```bash
    kubectl -f whatap_kube_fargate.yaml apply
    ```

{@include: _check-k8s-agent.mdx}

## Checking the cluster namespace

In 2-3 minutes after agent installation, select the project name from the menu on the left side of the [Whatap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io) screen. Check the list of namespaces in use, and then select + to create a new WhaTab project.

:::note

-   To proceed with the application agent installation, select **_Application Agent Installation_** at the lower right of the screen. For more information, see [the following](install-application-agent).
-   To update the agent to the latest version, see [the following](agent-update).
