The MSA analysis function analyzes the proportion of calls between transactions collected through the WhaTap's MTRACE (multi-server tracing) function. Based on this, dependencies between microservices can be checked at the URL level rather than instance-centric basis.

![Microservice Architecture Pattern](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_msa_pattern.png)

For example, there are five microservices: A, B, C, D, and E. If a user calls A, it is assumed that the following three call patterns occur according to the logic. 

1.  A→B, C calls
2.  A→B, C calls + then B→D call
3.  A→B, C calls + then B→D, E calls 

If these three patterns have been performed once, MSA analysis can check the association analysis data depending on the reference URL.

## MSA Transaction Statistics

The following lists all the transaction statistics that have callers or callees.

For more information about MTRACE, see [the following](../java/trs-multi-trace).

If you select a URL from the statistical data above, you can check the data details for the URL.

-   Caller Callee Summary
-   Caller Callee Data
-   Caller Callee Trend

## Caller Callee Summary

Dependency data between the caller and callee of the URL appears as follows. At this time, numerical data whose maximum is 1 such as 0.004 and 0.003, appears together, which indicates the proportion of all callers. Likewise, the gravities for each callee appear on the right.

Through the above screen, you can analyze the dependencies between callers and callees based on the _/account/save/employee/seoul_ transaction.

Caller or callee nodes can be developed in detail to sub-nodes.

## Caller & Callee Data

The correlations between callers and callees for the reference URL (e.g. _/account/save/employee/seoul_) can be displayed in a table as follows.

## Caller Callee Trend

The reference URL (_/account/save/employee/seoul_) and the trend of calls between a caller or a callee can be analyzed in time series as follows.

The above screen represents the trend of calls of the _/account/save/employee/seoul_ and /account/delete/division/daejun URLs.
